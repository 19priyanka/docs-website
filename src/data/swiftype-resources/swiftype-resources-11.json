Learn how to connect this integration to infrastructure monitoring and about the metric data and inventory data that New Relic reports for this integration. Features Google Cloud Storage is a Google Cloud Platform service that you can use to serve website content, to store data for archival and disaster recovery, and to distribute data objects via direct download. With the Google Cloud Storage integration, you can access these features: View charts and information about the data you are storing and retrieving from Google Cloud Storage. Create custom queries and charts in from automatically captured data. Set alerts on your Google Cloud Storage data directly from the Integrations page. Activate integration To enable the integration follow standard procedures to connect your GCP service to New Relic. Polling frequency New Relic queries your Google Cloud Storage services based on a polling interval of 5 minutes. Find and use data After connecting the integration to New Relic and waiting a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use integration data, including your dashboards and your alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Google Cloud Storage. To create custom dashboards for the integration, create queries for the GcpStorageBucketSample event type with the provider value GcpStorageBucket. Metric data The integration reports metric data for all values of method and response_code: response_code: The response code of the requests. method: The name of the API method called. The metric data that New Relic receives from your Google Cloud Storage integration includes: Metric Description api.Requests Delta count of API calls. network.ReceivedBytes Delta count of bytes received over the network. network.SentBytes Delta count of bytes sent over the network. Inventory data Inventory data for Google Cloud Storage bucket objects includes the following properties: Inventory data Description acl Access control list for the bucket that lets you specify who has access to your data and to what extent. cors The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration for the bucket. createTime Time when the bucket was created. defaultAcl Default access control list configuration for the bucket's blobs. etag HTTP 1.1 entity tag for the bucket. indexPage The bucket's website index page. This behaves as the bucket's directory index where missing blobs are treated as potential directories. labels Labels for the bucket, in key/value pairs. This is only available if the GCP project is linked to New Relic through a service account and extended inventory collection is enabled. metageneration The generation of the metadata for the bucket. name The name of the bucket. notFoundPage The custom object that will be returned when a requested resource is not found. owner The owner of the bucket. A bucket is always owned by the project team owners group. project The name that you assigned to the project. A project consists of a set of users, a set of APIs, and settings for those APIs. requesterPays If set to true, the user accessing the bucket or an object it contains assumes the access transit costs. storageClass The default storage class for a bucket, if you don't specify one for a new object. The storage class defines how Google Cloud Storage stores objects in the bucket and determines the SLA and storage cost. For more information, see storage classes. zone The zone where the bucket is deployed.",

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes. Integration Permissions Google AppEngine n/a; Google App Engine does not require additional permissions. Google BigQuery bigquery.datasets.get bigquery.tables.get bigquery.tables.list Google Cloud Functions cloudfunctions.locations.list Google Cloud Load Balancing n/a; Google Cloud Load Balancing does not require additional permissions. Google Cloud Pub/Sub pubsub.subscriptions.get pubsub.subscriptions.list pubsub.topics.get pubsub.topics.list Google Cloud Spanner spanner.instances.list spanner.databases.list spanner.databases.getDdl Google Cloud SQL cloudsql.instances.list Google Cloud Storage storage.buckets.list Google Compute Engine compute.instances.list compute.disks.get compute.disks.list Google Kubernetes Engine container.clusters.list Permissions to link projects through the UI To be able to see the list of projects that you can link to New Relic through the UI, your New Relic authorized service account needs the following permissions: resourcemanager.projects.get monitoring.monitoredResourceDescriptors.list If you do not want to grant New Relic authorized account the permissions that are needed for the linking process through the UI, you have the following options: Assign the Role Viewer or Monitoring Viewer role initially to the authorized account to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic through the UI. After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL cloud integrations API tutorial.",

If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic.

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "To read the relevant data from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account, New Relic uses the Google Stackdriver API and also other specific services APIs. To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic. This does not involve listing the viewable projects. However, you must know the id of the project you want to monitor.

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account.

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. Install the infrastructure monitoring agent Linux If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. Windows Server and 10 If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually using our MSI installer, see our tutorial. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Infrastructre can also be deployed in macOS. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL). Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent. Learn how to manage the agent.",

Types of infrastructure integrations New Relic has two main categories of infrastructure integrations: cloud and on-host. Cloud integrations Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

      "body": "In Grafana, you can configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source. Not only that, within Grafana you can query metrics stored in New Relic using the PromQL query language. Use existing Grafana dashboards with New Relic When you integrate Prometheus metrics with New Relic via Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration (2.0+) and configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source in Grafana, you can use existing Grafana dashboards and seamlessly tap into the additional monitoring, reliability, and scale we provide. Compatibility and requirements Before you begin, make sure you’ve finished integrating Prometheus metrics and are running a recent enough version of Grafana. You should have either the Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration ( v2.0+) set up before you can configure New Relic Prometheus data sources in Grafana. You can only configure New Relic Prometheus data sources using this method in Grafana versions 6.7.0 or newer. You will need to configure custom headers in the UI, and this isn’t possible with earlier versions. For details, see Configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source for Grafana. Support for PromQL Our Prometheus API emulates Prometheus' query APIs. We support the Prometheus query language (PromQL) through our PromQL-style query mode. We do our best to automatically translate PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. For more information on how this works and differences you may observe between Prometheus and New Relic, see Supported PromQL features. Get data flowing in Grafana To make your New Relic data available in Grafana, you can configure a new or existing Prometheus data source in just a couple of simple steps: In the Grafana UI, add and configure a new data source. Save the new data source and start viewing your data. What’s next? Ready to configure a Grafana data source?

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on.

Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten).

If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer.

Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Important Have you tried our new Network Performance Monitoring? Collect both SNMP and Network Flows to answer the question Is it the network? faster. Our SNMP integration monitors any application that exposes metrics with SNMP. Read on to install the integration, and to configure a YAML file to start collecting metrics. This doc also contains sample YAML files to help you get started. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with SNMP version 2 or 3. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: SNMP monitoring enabled device or application. If SNMP is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running SNMP. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Install and activate To install the SNMP integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-snmp.

Edit the snmp-metrics.yml file as described in the metric collection files. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config files. For an example configuration, see the host connection file example. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Integration configuration The configuration accepts the following arguments. snmp_host: The host SNMP is running on. Default: localhost. This field is required. snmp_port: The port SNMP is running on. Default: 161. This field is required. timeout: The number of seconds to wait before a request times out. Default: 10. retries: The number of attemps to fetch metrics. Default: 0. exponential_timeout: Doubles timeout value in each retry attempt. Default: false. v2: Use SNMP version 2 Default: true. v3: Use SNMP version 3. Default: false. community: The SNMP v2 community string. Default: public. This field is applicable only for SNMP v2. username: The security name that identifies an SNMP v3 user. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. security_level: The security level. Valid values are noAuthnoPriv,. authNoPriv or authPriv. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. auth_protocol: The authentication protocol. It can be either MD5 or SHA. Default: MD5. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. auth_passphrase: The password used to generate the key used for authentication. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. priv_protocol: The encryption protocol. It can be AES or DES. Default: AES. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. priv_passphrase: The password used to generate the key used to encrypt messages. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. collection_files: Comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. Default: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/snmp-metrics.yml. Metric collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Sample metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/snmp-metrics.yml.sample Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file below for an example. Devices A collection file collects and organizes metrics. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains one or more devices. For each device, the following keys are defined: device: The name of the SNMP device from which metrics are being collected. This field is required. metrics_sets: A list of metric sets that organize metrics to collect from this device. See Metric Sets. inventory: A list of Object Identifiers (OIDs) to collect from this device and report as inventory. See Inventory. Metric Sets Metrics Set represents a logical grouping of SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) to get from the SNMP device and report to New Relic. For each metric set, the following keys are defined: name: The metric set name. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this metric set. For tips on naming event types, see Naming tips. type: The metric set type. Use scalar to describe a metric set of SNMP scalar OIDs or table to describe a metric set that corresponds to the metrics from an SNMP table. root_oid: If type is a table, enter the root OID of the table. The integration performs an SNMP walk from this OID to get the table metrics. index: If type is a table, enter one or more table column index OIDs that define the table's row uniquely. For each index OID, the following keys are defined: oid: The OID name to collect, e.g., .1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.2.1.1.1. This field is required. name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the OID name. metrics: List of SNMP OIDs to be collected as part of this metric set. Enter a list of scalar OIDs or table column OIDs as appropriate for the type. oid: The OID name to collect, e.g., 1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.1.2.0​. This field is required. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the OID name. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are gauge, delta, pdelta, rate, prate or attribute. If unspecified, the integration attempts to infer the metric type . Inventory Inventory is an array of SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) to be collected and reported as inventory items. For each OID, the following keys are defined: oid: The OID name to collect, e.g., 1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.1.4.0. This field is required. category: The category name under which the inventory item will appear in New Relic. This field is required. name: The name under which the inventory item will appear in New Relic. This field is required.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the SNMP data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is not reported to an integration dashboard because the samples gathered are generally unique to the device being monitored. You will need to build your own dashboard. SNMP metrics are attached to the user defined event type specified in the configuration file. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the collection they are collecting from. This metadata should be used in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired metric set. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description device The device name for these metrics. host The SNMP host the metrics are being collected from. port The SNMP port the metrics are being collected from. displayName The metric set name for these metrics. Inventory data The SNMP integration captures the configuration parameters of the SNMP integration. The data is available on the Infrastructure Inventory page, under the config/snmp source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, you can check the log file for this message: Important \"Metric Set x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This metric set will not be reported.\" If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported metric set. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data.

If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent.

In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache.

N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication.

For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled.

N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data.

Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication.

For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config files. For an example configuration, see the host connection file example. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Integration configuration The configuration accepts the following arguments. snmp_host: The host SNMP is running on. Default: localhost. This field is required. snmp_port: The port SNMP is running on. Default: 161. This field is required. timeout: The number of seconds to wait before a request times out. Default: 10. retries: The number of attemps to fetch metrics. Default: 0. exponential_timeout: Doubles timeout value in each retry attempt. Default: false. v2: Use SNMP version 2 Default: true. v3: Use SNMP version 3. Default: false. community: The SNMP v2 community string. Default: public. This field is applicable only for SNMP v2. username: The security name that identifies an SNMP v3 user. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. security_level: The security level. Valid values are noAuthnoPriv,. authNoPriv or authPriv. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. auth_protocol: The authentication protocol. It can be either MD5 or SHA. Default: MD5. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. auth_passphrase: The password used to generate the key used for authentication. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. priv_protocol: The encryption protocol. It can be AES or DES. Default: AES. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. priv_passphrase: The password used to generate the key used to encrypt messages. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. collection_files: Comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. Default: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/snmp-metrics.yml. Metric collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Sample metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/snmp-metrics.yml.sample Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file below for an example. Devices A collection file collects and organizes metrics. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains one or more devices. For each device, the following keys are defined: device: The name of the SNMP device from which metrics are being collected. This field is required. metrics_sets: A list of metric sets that organize metrics to collect from this device. See Metric Sets. inventory: A list of Object Identifiers (OIDs) to collect from this device and report as inventory. See Inventory. Metric Sets Metrics Set represents a logical grouping of SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) to get from the SNMP device and report to New Relic. For each metric set, the following keys are defined: name: The metric set name. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this metric set. For tips on naming event types, see Naming tips. type: The metric set type. Use scalar to describe a metric set of SNMP scalar OIDs or table to describe a metric set that corresponds to the metrics from an SNMP table. root_oid: If type is a table, enter the root OID of the table. The integration performs an SNMP walk from this OID to get the table metrics. index: If type is a table, enter one or more table column index OIDs that define the table's row uniquely. For each index OID, the following keys are defined: oid: The OID name to collect, e.g., .1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.2.1.1.1. This field is required. name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the OID name. metrics: List of SNMP OIDs to be collected as part of this metric set. Enter a list of scalar OIDs or table column OIDs as appropriate for the type. oid: The OID name to collect, e.g., 1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.1.2.0​. This field is required. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the OID name. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are gauge, delta, pdelta, rate, prate or attribute. If unspecified, the integration attempts to infer the metric type . Inventory Inventory is an array of SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) to be collected and reported as inventory items. For each OID, the following keys are defined: oid: The OID name to collect, e.g., 1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.1.4.0. This field is required. category: The category name under which the inventory item will appear in New Relic. This field is required. name: The name under which the inventory item will appear in New Relic. This field is required.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the SNMP data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is not reported to an integration dashboard because the samples gathered are generally unique to the device being monitored. You will need to build your own dashboard. SNMP metrics are attached to the user defined event type specified in the configuration file. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the collection they are collecting from. This metadata should be used in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired metric set. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description device The device name for these metrics. host The SNMP host the metrics are being collected from. port The SNMP port the metrics are being collected from. displayName The metric set name for these metrics. Inventory data The SNMP integration captures the configuration parameters of the SNMP integration. The data is available on the Infrastructure Inventory page, under the config/snmp source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, you can check the log file for this message: Important \"Metric Set x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This metric set will not be reported.\" If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported metric set. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten).

Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Important Have you tried our new Network Performance Monitoring? Collect both SNMP and Network Flows to answer the question Is it the network? faster. Our SNMP integration monitors any application that exposes metrics with SNMP. Read on to install the integration, and to configure a YAML file to start collecting metrics. This doc also contains sample YAML files to help you get started. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with SNMP version 2 or 3. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: SNMP monitoring enabled device or application. If SNMP is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running SNMP. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Install and activate To install the SNMP integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-snmp. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration and metrics files: sudo cp snmp-config.yml.sample snmp-config.yml Copy sudo cp snmp-metrics.yml.sample snmp-metrics.yml Copy Edit the snmp-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Edit the snmp-metrics.yml file as described in the metric collection files. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-snmp .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-snmp/nri-snmp-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-snmp-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer.

Edit the snmp-metrics.yml file as described in the metric collection files. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config files. For an example configuration, see the host connection file example. Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Integration configuration The configuration accepts the following arguments. snmp_host: The host SNMP is running on. Default: localhost. This field is required. snmp_port: The port SNMP is running on. Default: 161. This field is required. timeout: The number of seconds to wait before a request times out. Default: 10. retries: The number of attemps to fetch metrics. Default: 0. exponential_timeout: Doubles timeout value in each retry attempt. Default: false. v2: Use SNMP version 2 Default: true. v3: Use SNMP version 3. Default: false. community: The SNMP v2 community string. Default: public. This field is applicable only for SNMP v2. username: The security name that identifies an SNMP v3 user. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. security_level: The security level. Valid values are noAuthnoPriv,. authNoPriv or authPriv. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. auth_protocol: The authentication protocol. It can be either MD5 or SHA. Default: MD5. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. auth_passphrase: The password used to generate the key used for authentication. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. priv_protocol: The encryption protocol. It can be AES or DES. Default: AES. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. priv_passphrase: The password used to generate the key used to encrypt messages. This field is applicable only for SNMP v3. collection_files: Comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. Default: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/snmp-metrics.yml. Metric collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Sample metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/snmp-metrics.yml.sample Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file below for an example. Devices A collection file collects and organizes metrics. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains one or more devices. For each device, the following keys are defined: device: The name of the SNMP device from which metrics are being collected. This field is required. metrics_sets: A list of metric sets that organize metrics to collect from this device. See Metric Sets. inventory: A list of Object Identifiers (OIDs) to collect from this device and report as inventory. See Inventory. Metric Sets Metrics Set represents a logical grouping of SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) to get from the SNMP device and report to New Relic. For each metric set, the following keys are defined: name: The metric set name. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this metric set. For tips on naming event types, see Naming tips. type: The metric set type. Use scalar to describe a metric set of SNMP scalar OIDs or table to describe a metric set that corresponds to the metrics from an SNMP table. root_oid: If type is a table, enter the root OID of the table. The integration performs an SNMP walk from this OID to get the table metrics. index: If type is a table, enter one or more table column index OIDs that define the table's row uniquely. For each index OID, the following keys are defined: oid: The OID name to collect, e.g., .1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.2.1.1.1. This field is required. name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the OID name. metrics: List of SNMP OIDs to be collected as part of this metric set. Enter a list of scalar OIDs or table column OIDs as appropriate for the type. oid: The OID name to collect, e.g., 1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.1.2.0​. This field is required. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the OID name. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are gauge, delta, pdelta, rate, prate or attribute. If unspecified, the integration attempts to infer the metric type . Inventory Inventory is an array of SNMP Object Identifiers (OIDs) to be collected and reported as inventory items. For each OID, the following keys are defined: oid: The OID name to collect, e.g., 1.3.6.1.4.1.52032.1.1.4.0. This field is required. category: The category name under which the inventory item will appear in New Relic. This field is required. name: The name under which the inventory item will appear in New Relic. This field is required.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the SNMP data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is not reported to an integration dashboard because the samples gathered are generally unique to the device being monitored. You will need to build your own dashboard. SNMP metrics are attached to the user defined event type specified in the configuration file. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the collection they are collecting from. This metadata should be used in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired metric set. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description device The device name for these metrics. host The SNMP host the metrics are being collected from. port The SNMP port the metrics are being collected from. displayName The metric set name for these metrics. Inventory data The SNMP integration captures the configuration parameters of the SNMP integration. The data is available on the Infrastructure Inventory page, under the config/snmp source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, you can check the log file for this message: Important \"Metric Set x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This metric set will not be reported.\" If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported metric set. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml.

The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled.

N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication.

For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled.

N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data.

Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data.

Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled.

N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on.

Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten).

If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set.

Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Read how to generate a new License key. Docker installed in your local machine. SSH access to the Docker host, with the ability to launch new containers. Access to Layer 2/3 network devices that can generate and send network flow data, and also add and modify network flow targets on the device. Here's how to configure network flow data collection in some devices: NetFlow data Palo Alto - PAN-OS Fortinet Fortigate Cisco - NX-OS Cisco - IOS Cisco - Meraki sFlow data F5 - BIG-IP jFlow data Juniper - Junos Network security prerequisites Direction Source Destination Ports Protocol Outbound Docker host Kentik's docker image GitHub repository 80, 443 UDP, TCP Outbound Docker host EU Logs endpoint https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy US Logs endpoint https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy 80, 443 UDP, TCP Outbound Docker host EU Events endpoint http://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net/ Copy US Events endpoint http://insights-collector.newrelic.com/ Copy 80, 443 UDP, TCP Inbound Network flow data device Docker host 9995 UDP Supported types of network flow data Kentik's integration supports four types of network flow data. When running the ktranslate image, you can specify which type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate image only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetflowV9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. To check the equivalence among the network flow data type and the value you need to specify when running the image, see the following table: Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow version 5 netflow5 NetFlow version 9 netflow9 sFlow sflow Important For Juniper Networks' jFlow, use the netflow5 value. Scaling Network Flow Collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference. Set up network flow data monitoring in New Relic One In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices variable with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file. Run ktranslate to poll network flow devices by entering the following commands: Important Add your New Relic License key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > nr1.flow $ ## If your account is located in Europe, you need to add the following option before the nr1.flow line $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ To get better visibility into your network, set up SNMP data monitoring.

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform.

NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system. Example: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status You can read more about the status_url in these NGINX docs: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module There are different ways to set status_url, depending on how NGINX was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: See Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. Important Our support of OTLP ingest is currently in pre-release. To particiapte in the pre-release program, please complete this form, and we'll send you details. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic: Tip If you prefer to export your data to an OpenTelemetry collector, see our instructions below. To complete this step, you'll follow the OTLP exporter documenentation for your language. Before you go to this external documentation, keep in mind you'll need to configure the OTLP exporter to send data to New Relic. This includes setting the header and configuring the endpoint: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header ( api-key ) whose value is your Account License Key. Configure the endpoint for the exporter to point to New Relic. You'll receive the endpoint URL when you sign up for the pre-release program. Now, follow the instructions for your language: Important Make sure you are following the instructions for the OTLP gRPC exporter for your language. New Relic doesn't currently support OTLP HTTP exporters. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. The difference in this case is that instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export it to a collector that you set up. Then, in the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector, making sure you replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the endpoint you received when signing up for the pre-release and replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your Account License Key: export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --config otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic. What's next?

It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects (initially, traces and metrics are supported, followed by logs) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss it directly with us at New Relic to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic APM agents In general, New Relic APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemtry community to export your data to New Relic. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started. You'll also want to review the best practices guide for getting the most out of the data you export to New Relic.",

You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication.

Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document.

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install.

Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Apache integration sends performance metrics and inventory data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts. The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS.

Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data. Quick start Instrument your Redis server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Redis integration, follow the instructions for your environment: Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow installation outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-redis. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp redis-config.yml.sample redis-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-config.yml file based on your Redis server connection methods: Connect with Unix socket If you connect using Unix socket, specify the unix_socket_path in the configuration file. If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

The integration works by gathering data from Apache's status module, so that module must be enabled and configured for your Apache instance (more details in Requirements). Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Apache versions 2.2 or 2.4. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Apache status module enabled and configured for Apache instance. Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) available from the host containing the Apache integration. If Apache is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must have the infrastructure agent installed on a Linux OS host that's running Apache. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your Apache web server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Apache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Apache web server. Install and activate To install the Apache integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-apache. Change directory to the integration's folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp apache-config.yml.sample apache-config.yml Copy Edit the apache-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your Apache server To capture data from the Apache integration, you must first enable and configure the status module: Ensure the Apache status module is enabled and configured for Apache instance. Ensure the Apache status module endpoint (default server-status) is available from the host containing the Apache integration. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, apache-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files, please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Apache are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Apache instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Apache Instance Settings The Apache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Alternative Certificate Authority bundle file. N/A M CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true M REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels; however, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects metrics and inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy METRICS ONLY WITH ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have one integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added CA_BUNDLE_FILE pointing to an alternative certificate file: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_apache_host/server-status?auto CA_BUNDLE_FILE='/etc/ssl/certs/custom-ca.crt' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable APACHE_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{APACHE_STATUS}} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple Apache servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_apache_host/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Apache data is attached to the ApacheSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Apache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as net. or server.. Name Description net.bytesPerSecond Rate of the number of bytes served, in bytes per second. net.requestsPerSecond Rate of the number of client requests, in requests per second. server.busyWorkers Current number of busy workers. server.idleWorkers Current number of idle workers. server.scoreboard.closingWorkers Current number of workers closing TCP connection after serving the response. server.scoreboard.dnsLookupWorkers Current number of workers performing a DNS lookup. server.scoreboard.finishingWorkers Current number of workers gracefully finishing. server.scoreboard.idleCleanupWorkers Current number of idle workers ready for cleanup. server.scoreboard.keepAliveWorkers Current number of workers maintaining a keep-alive connection. server.scoreboard.loggingWorkers Current number of workers that are logging. server.scoreboard.readingWorkers Current number of workers reading requests (headers or body). server.scoreboard.startingWorkers Current number of workers that are starting up. server.scoreboard.totalWorkers Total number of workers available. Workers that are not needed to process requests may not be started. server.scoreboard.writingWorkers Current number of workers that are writing. Inventory data Inventory data captures the version numbers from running Apache and from all loaded Apache modules, and adds those version numbers under the config/apache namespace. For more about inventory data, see Understand data. System metadata Besides the standard attributes collected by the infrastructure agent, the integration collects inventory data associated with the ApacheSample event type: Name Description software.version The version of the Apache server. Example: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu). Troubleshooting Problem accessing HTTPS endpoint for Apache If you are having issues accessing the HTTPS endpoint for Apache, here are two possible solutions: Although you cannot ignore the SSL certification, you can set the config file parameters ca_bundle_file and ca_bundle_dir to point to an unsigned certificate in the Apache config file. Example: instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto ca_bundle_file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl/b2b.ca-bundle Copy An example using ca_bundle_dir: ca_bundle_dir: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ssl Copy Alternatively, you can use HTTP instead of HTTPS. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten).

The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy redis-win-config.yml.sample redis-win-config.yml Copy Edit the redis-win-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Create a New Relic user for your Redis server If you're using Redis 6+ and using access control lists (ACLs) to control access to your instance, you may want to create a newrelic user for the integration. Use this command to create and grant the required permissions to your user: ACL SETUSER newrelic on >'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD' ~* +INFO +CONFIG|GET +SELECT +TYPE +LLEN +SCARD +ZCOUNT +HLEN Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML configuration file redis-config.yml. Use the YAML configuration to place required login credentials and configure how your data is collected, depending on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To learn more about these common settings, see our YAML configuration format. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, use our older, standard configuration foramt. Specific settings related to Redis are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Redis instance as well as other security settings and features. Redis instance settings The Redis integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Redis server hostname. localhost M/I PORT Port where Redis server is listening. 6379 M/I USERNAME Username to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

Our integration collects Kubernetes data by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. For a simpler and more visual experience, use the cluster explorer. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can query your Kubernetes data and create clear visualizations. Query Kubernetes data The simplest way to query your Kubernetes data is using the query builder, which accepts NRQL queries. Alternatively, you can use the NerdGraph API to retrieve Kubernetes data. Event types Kubernetes data is attached to the following event types: Event name Type of Kubernetes data Available since K8sNodeSample Node data v1.0.0 K8sNamespaceSample Namespace data v1.0.0 K8sDeploymentSample Deployment data v1.0.0 K8sReplicasetSample ReplicaSet data v1.0.0 K8sDaemonsetSample DaemonSet data v1.13.0 K8sStatefulsetSample StatefulSet data v1.13.0 K8sPodSample Pod data v1.0.0 K8sClusterSample Cluster data v1.0.0 K8sContainerSample Container data v1.0.0 K8sVolumeSample Volume data v1.0.0 K8sApiServerSample API server data v1.11.0 K8sControllerManagerSample Controller manager data v1.11.0 K8sSchedulerSample Scheduler data v1.11.0 K8sEtcdSample ETCD data v1.11.0 K8sEndpointSample Endpoint data v1.13.0 K8sServiceSample Service data v1.13.0 K8sHpaSample Horizontal Pod Autoscaler data v2.3.0 Manage alerts You can be notified about alert violations for your Kubernetes data: Create an alert condition To create an alert condition for the Kubernetes integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts > Kubernetes, then select Create alert condition. To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our Redis integration reports critical performance data from your Redis server to New Relic products. You can view this metric data and inventory data in pre-built dashboards, create alert policies, and create custom queries and charts. You can also specify keys that are important to your application and get information about their length. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Redis versions 3.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If Redis is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running Redis. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. The integration obtains data by executing Redis commands: INFO command: Data from the INFO command populates metric data and some inventory data. CONFIG GET command: Most inventory data comes from this command. In managed Redis installations without permissions to execute the CONFIG command (for example, AWS ElastiCache), the execution of this command can be disabled with the config_inventory: false configuration option. Key length acquisition: Depending on the type of key, these commands are used: LLEN for list SCARD for set ZCOUNT for zset HLEN for hash type. For key length data collection, the agent uses pipelining to minimize the impact on your Redis performance. However, if you are collecting the length of many keys, your Redis performance may be affected. For this reason, the agent includes a default key limit (but this limit can be overwritten). Important If you edited the names of the Redis commands mentioned above, the integration will not be able to retrieve the Redis data.

If there are more than one Redis instance using Unix sockets, make sure to set use_unix_socket to true in the configuration file. Be sure that the user executing the Redis integration has correct permissions for accessing that Unix socket. The permissions of the Unix socket are set in the Redis configuration (value of unixsocketperm). Connect with TCP If you connect via TCP, the config file is by default set to localhost and port 6379. You can change this by specifying hostname and/or the port argument. If you use this method, the unix_socket_path parameter cannot be set. If required, set other configuration file settings based on your Redis setup, as described in Configuration. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-redis .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-redis/nri-redis-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-redis-amd64.msi Copy or double-click the file in Explorer.

Use only with Redis 6+ if ACL is enabled. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password to use when connecting to the Redis server. Use only with Redis servers if REQUIREPASS or ACL is enabled. N/A M/I UNIX_SOCKET_PATH Path to Unix socket file on which Redis server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A M/I USE_UNIX_SOCKET Set to true to uniquely identify the monitored entities when using Unix sockets. false M/I USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the Redis server. false M/I TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false M/I KEYS List of the keys for retrieving their lengths. N/A M KEYS_LIMIT Max number of keys to retrieve their lengths. 30 M CONFIG_INVENTORY Set to 'false' in environments where the Redis CONFIG command is not allowed (for example, AWS or ElastiCache). true I RENAMED_COMMANDS Map default Redis commands to their renamed form. N/A M/I REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true M/I METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Basic authentication This configuration connects to Redis using basic authentication. Replace my_password with your REQUIREPASS password: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy REDIS 6+ ACL authentication In Redis 6+, you can protect your instance with Access Control Lists (ACLs). For ACLs, replace the USERNAME and PASSWORD values with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USERNAME: my_user PASSWORD: my_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to Redis with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to Redis using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true UNIX_SOCKET_PATH: /var/run/redis/redis.sock USE_UNIX_SOCKET: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Using renamed commands Use this to collect your metrics/inventory if you've used the rename-command to protect your instance: integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: {\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\",\"LLEN\":\"c940fc2d15f59e41cb7be6c21\"} REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 6379 RENAMED_COMMANDS: '{\"CONFIG\":\"b840fc9f15f59e41cb7be6c52\"}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/redis Copy Multi-instance monitoring with keys filtering Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different Redis servers using the the same integration. The first instance example is only collecting KEY_1 amd KEY_2 from Redis database 0. The second instance example shows how to collect from different databases with {\"DB\":\"KEYS\"}. integrations: - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_1 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"]' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-redis env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: redis_host_2 PORT: 6379 KEYS: '{\"0\":[\"KEY_1\",\"KEY_2\"],\"1\":[\"KEY_3\"]}' REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the RedisSample and RedisKeyspaceSample event types. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data.

Format: db followed by the database index. For example: db0, db1, db2, etc. db.expires Number of keys with an expiration in the database being reported on. Inventory data Inventory data includes everything reported by the Redis CONFIG GET command, with the exception of requirepass, which stores the password to the Redis server. For more on inventory data, see Understand inventory data. Other system data The Redis integration collects these additional attributes about your Redis service: Name Description software.version The version of the Redis server. Example: 3.2.3. cluster.role Either master or slave, depending on the role of the Redis node being monitored. Check the source code This integration is open source software.

Our integration collects Kubernetes data by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. For a simpler and more visual experience, use the cluster explorer. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can query your Kubernetes data and create clear visualizations. Query Kubernetes data The simplest way to query your Kubernetes data is using the query builder, which accepts NRQL queries. Alternatively, you can use the NerdGraph API to retrieve Kubernetes data. Event types Kubernetes data is attached to the following event types: Event name Type of Kubernetes data Available since K8sNodeSample Node data v1.0.0 K8sNamespaceSample Namespace data v1.0.0 K8sDeploymentSample Deployment data v1.0.0 K8sReplicasetSample ReplicaSet data v1.0.0 K8sDaemonsetSample DaemonSet data v1.13.0 K8sStatefulsetSample StatefulSet data v1.13.0 K8sPodSample Pod data v1.0.0 K8sClusterSample Cluster data v1.0.0 K8sContainerSample Container data v1.0.0 K8sVolumeSample Volume data v1.0.0 K8sApiServerSample API server data v1.11.0 K8sControllerManagerSample Controller manager data v1.11.0 K8sSchedulerSample Scheduler data v1.11.0 K8sEtcdSample ETCD data v1.11.0 K8sEndpointSample Endpoint data v1.13.0 K8sServiceSample Service data v1.13.0 K8sHpaSample Horizontal Pod Autoscaler data v2.3.0 Manage alerts You can be notified about alert violations for your Kubernetes data: Create an alert condition To create an alert condition for the Kubernetes integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Alerts > Kubernetes, then select Create alert condition. To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files. The infrastructure agent registers every integration executable defined in the definition file. The agent scans a dedicated directory for integration configuration files. If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration.

      "body": "Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Types of infrastructure integrations New Relic has two main categories of infrastructure integrations: cloud and on-host. Cloud integrations Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes.

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

The dashboards show counts and frequencies for those API calls. You may want to monitor these for two reasons: API calls can cost money, and your API usage may be throttled at certain usage levels. To decrease usage, you can configure integration settings to reduce the number of components you monitor or how frequently they're monitored. Troubleshoot missing data or other data issues.

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, Windows, and macOS. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. Install the infrastructure monitoring agent Linux If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. Windows Server and 10 If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually using our MSI installer, see our tutorial. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Infrastructre can also be deployed in macOS. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL). Enable log forwarding using the infrastructure agent. Learn how to manage the agent.",

Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

You’re in control because you understand your system New Relic helps you cut through the layers of complexity surrounding your systems by bringing together and connecting data from any instrumented source and environment, without having to jump between tools. You can interrogate your data for patterns, discover them using our data platform, or get proactive results from our machine learning tools. New Relic provides answers to essential questions in one place. All the answers in one place As a full user you get access to our entire set of observability tools. All our tools are interconnected and accessible in New Relic One. All the data you bring to New Relic through agents and integrations are metrics, events, logs, and traces that feed our platform's analytics and monitoring capabilities. New Relic links your data in a meaningful way so that you can explore it, build dashboards, and set up alerts. Full-Stack Observability curated experiences allow to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire software stack in one unified platform. The New Relic Explorer consolidates all the entities in your system, and how they're connected, in a single place, so you can easily detect performance trends and issues. By automatically connecting infrastructure health with application performance and end-user behavior, you can cut through the noise to find the signal. Start anywhere Being fully-connected, New Relic allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple, yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but it can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces.

Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes.

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Cloud integrations Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, Windows, and macOS. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. Install the infrastructure monitoring agent Linux If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. Windows Server and 10 If you don't have a New Relic account yet, the guided install doesn't work, or prefer to follow the procedure manually using our MSI installer, see our tutorial. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Infrastructre can also be deployed in macOS. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic.

      "body": "New Relic offers various integrations for reporting data to our platform. One category of integrations is our Infrastructure integrations. Types of infrastructure integrations New Relic has two main categories of infrastructure integrations: cloud and on-host. Cloud integrations Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic offers various integrations for reporting data to our platform. One category of integrations is our Infrastructure integrations. Types of infrastructure integrations New Relic has two main categories of infrastructure integrations: cloud and on-host. Cloud integrations Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer.

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic Kubernetes installation with Helm. To install the integration using manifests, see Kubernetes integration: install and configure. Start the installer Compatibility and requirements Our Helm chart is compatible with both Helm 2 and 3. Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Follow the instructions for your version of Helm: Helm 3 using nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to Logs. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Automatically injects metadata in applications deployed to the cluster to correlate APM monitoring with Infrastructure monitoring. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, allows to scrape Prometheus endpoints and report metrics to New Relic. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics for you if needed. We recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it provides the easiest way to select, install, and upgrade individual components at your will. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent isn't installed. helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=false \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy You can flip the ksm.enabled flag to true if KSM isn't already present in your cluster. Install the Kubernetes integration: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=false \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Configuring nri-bundle with Helm Enabling and disabling subcharts The nri-bundle chart pulls the following dependencies, if the corresponding flags are enabled: Subchart Flag newrelic-infrastructure infrastructure.enabled nri-prometheus prometheus.enabled nri-metadata-injection webhook.enabled kube-state-metrics ksm.enabled nri-kube-events kubeEvents.enabled newrelic-logging logging.enabled Configuring subcharts The nri-bundle chart leverages Helm's subchart configuration mechanism to configure its components. This means that you can supply the configuration values to the individual components of the chart, as listed at the beginning of this section, by prefixing them with the name of the chart. For example, to run the agent in unprivileged mode, you can add --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=false to the command above, where newrelic-infrastructure is the name of the sub-chart (as listed at the beginning of the section), and privileged is the configuration value for said chart. Please refer to each of the chart's README and their values.yml to see all available configuration options and their defaults. Helm 2 using newrelic-infrastructure Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy purposes only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Update via Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Get the release name of the newrelic-infrastructure chart: helm list Copy Update the release rerunning the appropriate helm upgrade --install command for your preferred installation method.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic Kubernetes installation with Helm. To install the integration using manifests, see Kubernetes integration: install and configure. Start the installer Compatibility and requirements Our Helm chart is compatible with both Helm 2 and 3. Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Follow the instructions for your version of Helm: Helm 3 using nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to Logs. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Automatically injects metadata in applications deployed to the cluster to correlate APM monitoring with Infrastructure monitoring. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, allows to scrape Prometheus endpoints and report metrics to New Relic. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics for you if needed. We recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it provides the easiest way to select, install, and upgrade individual components at your will. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent isn't installed. helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=false \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy You can flip the ksm.enabled flag to true if KSM isn't already present in your cluster. Install the Kubernetes integration: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set ksm.enabled=false \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Configuring nri-bundle with Helm Enabling and disabling subcharts The nri-bundle chart pulls the following dependencies, if the corresponding flags are enabled: Subchart Flag newrelic-infrastructure infrastructure.enabled nri-prometheus prometheus.enabled nri-metadata-injection webhook.enabled kube-state-metrics ksm.enabled nri-kube-events kubeEvents.enabled newrelic-logging logging.enabled Configuring subcharts The nri-bundle chart leverages Helm's subchart configuration mechanism to configure its components. This means that you can supply the configuration values to the individual components of the chart, as listed at the beginning of this section, by prefixing them with the name of the chart. For example, to run the agent in unprivileged mode, you can add --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=false to the command above, where newrelic-infrastructure is the name of the sub-chart (as listed at the beginning of the section), and privileged is the configuration value for said chart. Please refer to each of the chart's README and their values.yml to see all available configuration options and their defaults. Helm 2 using newrelic-infrastructure Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy purposes only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Update via Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Get the release name of the newrelic-infrastructure chart: helm list Copy Update the release rerunning the appropriate helm upgrade --install command for your preferred installation method.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

This tutorial shows how to enable monitoring for a Redis service running on the Kubernetes PHP Guestbook. For the general procedure, see Monitor a Kubernetes-running service. What you need See the general requirements for this feature, including supported services. The kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you don't have a cluster, you can create one using Minikube. Step 1: Set up an example Redis application This tutorial builds on the Kubernetes tutorial Deploying a PHP Guestbook application with Redis. Skip the Kubernetes tutorial and run the following command to set up the application needed for our tutorial: kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/examples/master/guestbook/all-in-one/guestbook-all-in-one.yaml Copy If you'd like to first complete the Kubernetes tutorial, follow their tutorial instructions but do not follow the instructions in the Cleaning up section. Step 2: Enable monitoring of Redis instances The PHP Guestbook application has three Redis instances: one master and two slave instances. Each instance is tagged with a label where app=redis. For this example, we're using our Redis monitoring integration. It can monitor both master and slave instances of Redis, so we don’t have to distinguish between them. In the Kubernetes integration's YAML config file (newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml), you need to update the nri-integration-cfg section. From the list of integration configs, get the Redis integration YAML and add it to the Kubernetes config. The Redis YAML is highlighted below. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: redis-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=redis\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.13.0 or higher (install | check version | update). We support the following services running on Kubernetes: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP Enable monitoring of services To enable our Kubernetes integration to monitor one or more services: Expand this dropdown and get the YAML snippets for the service(s) you want to monitor: Get the config YAML for the integration For the services you want to monitor, follow the links to GitHub to get the YAML snippets you'll need for the next step: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Add the snippet to the Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap, after the data: section: Example configuration This example shows the YAML config for the Apache integration ( highlighted ) added to the Kubernetes integration's config.

See an example. Depending on your environment, you may need or want to set additional config options. Expand the dropdown below for links to configuration options. Configuration options for each integration Select a service to see available config options: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Verify monitoring is enabled: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select Third party services, and then select the service's dashboard. You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Additionally, depending on your environment, there may be some additional service-specific configuration you must do. When you've completed configuration, our infrastructure agent looks for any pod with a label cassandra and runs the integration against it.",

      "body": "You can surface Kubernetes metadata and link it to your APM agents as distributed traces to explore performance issues and troubleshoot transaction errors. For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.13.0 or higher (install | check version | update). We support the following services running on Kubernetes: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP Enable monitoring of services To enable our Kubernetes integration to monitor one or more services: Expand this dropdown and get the YAML snippets for the service(s) you want to monitor: Get the config YAML for the integration For the services you want to monitor, follow the links to GitHub to get the YAML snippets you'll need for the next step: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Add the snippet to the Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap, after the data: section: Example configuration This example shows the YAML config for the Apache integration ( highlighted ) added to the Kubernetes integration's config.

See an example. Depending on your environment, you may need or want to set additional config options. Expand the dropdown below for links to configuration options. Configuration options for each integration Select a service to see available config options: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Verify monitoring is enabled: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select Third party services, and then select the service's dashboard. You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Additionally, depending on your environment, there may be some additional service-specific configuration you must do. When you've completed configuration, our infrastructure agent looks for any pod with a label cassandra and runs the integration against it.",

What you need See the general requirements for this feature, including supported services. The kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you don't have a cluster, you can create one using Minikube. Step 1: Set up an example Redis application This tutorial builds on the Kubernetes tutorial Deploying a PHP Guestbook application with Redis.

Step 2: Enable monitoring of Redis instances The PHP Guestbook application has three Redis instances: one master and two slave instances. Each instance is tagged with a label where app=redis. For this example, we're using our Redis monitoring integration. It can monitor both master and slave instances of Redis, so we don’t have to distinguish between them.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

Get the infrastructure agent version For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent is distributed as a Docker image that contains the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration. The Docker image is tagged with a version, and the infrastructure agent also has its own version. When the agent is successfully sending information to New Relic, you can retrieve the versions of the infrastructure agent for Kubernetes (the Docker image) you are running in your clusters by using the following NRQL query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName = 'newrelic-infra' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy If the agent is not reporting any data: Get the version(s) of the New Relic integration for Kubernetes that you are running in a cluster using kubectl: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l name=newrelic-infra -o jsonpath=\"{.items..spec..containers..image}\" Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic/infrastructure-k8s:1.0.0 Copy Get kube-state-metrics version To retrieve the version of kube-state-metrics running on your clusters, run the following NRQL query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE '%kube-state-metrics%' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy Get logs from pods connecting to kube-state-metrics To get the logs from pods connecting to kube-state-metrics: Get the nodes that kube-state-metrics is running on: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Look for output similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-pclhh 2/2 Running 4 4d 172.17.0.3 minikube Copy Get the New Relic pods that are running on the same node as kube-state-metrics: kubectl describe node minikube | grep newrelic-infra Copy Look for output similar to this: default newrelic-infra-5wcv6 100m (5%) 0 (0%) 100Mi (5%) 100Mi (5%) Copy Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-5wcv6 Copy Retrieve kube-state-metrics service configuration To retrieve the configuration: Run: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep \"kube-state-metrics\" Copy Look for a response similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-5wf9m 2/2 Running 8 6d Copy Review the namespace in the first column. kubectl describe service kube-state-metrics -n <namespace> Copy Get logs from pod running on a master node To get the logs from a pod running on a master node: Get the nodes that are labelled as master: kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" Copy Or, kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/role=\"master\" Copy Look for output similar to this: NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal Ready master 42d v1.14.8 Copy Get the New Relic pods that are running on one of the nodes returned in the previous step: kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy For troubleshooting help, see Not seeing data or Error messages.

With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer You can use the automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The installer can also help you with managed services or platforms after you review a few preliminary notes. We also have separate instructions if you need a custom manifest or prefer to do a manual unprivileged installation. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate For help installing our EKS Fargate integration, see these setup options. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. Ensure you have a RoleBinding that grants you the same permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: kubectl create clusterrolebinding YOUR_USERNAME-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=YOUR_GCP_EMAIL Copy Creating a RoleBinding is necessary because of a known RBAC issue in Kubernetes and Kubernetes Engine versions 1.6 or higher. For more information, see Google Cloud's documentation on defining permissions in a role. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR - name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Custom manifest If the Kubernetes automated installer doesn't provide the settings you need, you can download our manifest template and install the integration manually. To activate the Kubernetes integration, you must deploy the newrelic-infra agent onto a Kubernetes cluster as a DaemonSet: Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy In the DaemonSet portion of your manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Recommendation: Do not change the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT or NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME value in your manifest. YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy If you need to adapt the manifest to fit your environment, review the configure section in this doc. Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration is working: wait a few minutes, then look for data in the New Relic Kubernetes cluster explorer. If you don't see data, review the configuration procedures again, then follow the troubleshooting procedures. Important In the future, the number of labels collected on Kubernetes objects will be limited per object type (containers, pods, nodes, etc.). If objects have labels above the limit, you will be able to configure important labels that should always be sent to New Relic. When the limitation is in place, this documentation will be updated. Make sure New Relic pods can be scheduled Some of the New Relic pods are set up as DaemonSet in the manifest file so that they can run on every host. These include newrelic-infrastructure and newrelic-logging. In rare circumstances, other pods may be scheduled first and starve the New Relic pods of resources. Since each of these pods have to run on a specific host, they will stay in pending status until that host has enough resources, even if there are other hosts available. This could end up occurring for long periods of time and result in reporting gaps. To prevent this scenario, you can configure the Kubernetes scheduler to give New Relic pods a higher priority. Using the default scheduler: Ensure kube-scheduler flag disablePreemption is not set to true (by default it is false). Create a PriorityClass for the New Relic DaemonSet pods: Set the appropriate priority value, which should generally be higher than your other pods. preemptionPolicy is set to PreemptLowerPriority by default. This allows New Relic pods assigned this priority class to remove lower-priority pods that are taking up resources. Edit the manifest file to add priorityClassName to any DaemonSet specs. In the example below, the highlighted line sets the priority class for newrelic-infrastructure: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: DaemonSet metadata: namespace: default labels: app: newrelic-infrastructure chart: newrelic-infrastructure-1.0.0 release: nri-bundle mode: privileged name: nri-bundle-newrelic-infrastructure spec: priorityClassName: your-priority-class ... Copy If you have already deployed the New Relic pods, re-deploy them and confirm they have been created: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml kubectl get daemonsets Copy Unprivileged installs of the Kubernetes integration For platforms that have stringent security requirements, we provide an unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration. Changes from the standard Kubernetes integration are: Runs the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration as a standard user instead of root No access to the underlying host filesystem No access to /var/run/docker.sock Container's root filesystem mounted as read-only allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false hostnetwork is set to false The tradeoff is that the solution will only collect metrics from Kubernetes, but it will not collect any metric from the underlying hosts directly. Kubernetes provides some data (metrics and metadata) about its nodes (hosts). Tip Optional: To collect the underlying host metrics, the non-containerized infrastructure agent can be deployed on the underlying host. The infrastructure agent already supports running as non-root. The combination of the Kubernetes integration in its unprivileged version and the agent running on the host will report all the metrics that our standard solution for monitoring Kubernetes receives. Steps to complete an unprivileged install Install kube-state-metrics and get it running on the cluster. For example: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v 1.9.5 .zip && unzip kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 .zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics- 1.9.5 /examples/standard Copy Download the integration manifest: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy In the manifest, add your New Relic license key and a cluster name to identify your Kubernetes cluster. Both values are required. Important YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME is your cluster’s id in New Relic Explorer. It doesn’t need to match the name of the cluster running in your environment. env: - name: NRIA_LICENSE_KEY value: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY - name: CLUSTER_NAME value: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy YAML key path: spec.template.spec.containers.name.env Confirm that kube-state-metrics is installed. kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Create the DaemonSet: kubectl create -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy To confirm that the integration has been configured correctly, wait a few minutes, then run this NRQL query to see if data has been reported: SELECT * FROM K8sPodSample since 5 minutes ago Copy Configure the integration The Kubernetes integration comes with a default configuration that should work in most environments. To change the configuration, modify the manifest file: Select which processes should send their data to New Relic By default, data about the processes running on your pods is not sent to New Relic. You can enable it by setting enable_process_metrics to true. To choose what metric data you want to send to New Relic, configure the include_matching_metrics environment variable in your manifest. Specify the Kubernetes API host and port This is necessary when you are using SSL and not using the default FQDN. The Kubernetes API FQDN needs to match the FQDN of the SSL certificate. You do not need to specify both variables. For example, if you only specify the HOST, the default PORT will be used. - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_HOST\" - name: \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\" value: \"KUBERNETES_API_TCP_PORT\" Copy Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5: Edit manifest file For Kubernetes versions 1.6 to 1.7.5, uncomment these two lines in the manifest file: - name: \"CADVISOR_PORT\" # Enable direct connection to cAdvisor by specifying the port. Needed for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.7.6. value: \"4194\" Copy Use environment variables Use environment variables that can be passed to the Kubernetes integration if you use a proxy to configure its URL. Disable kube-state-metrics parsing You can disable kube-state-metrics parsing for the DaemonSet by using the following configuration: - name: \"DISABLE_KUBE_STATE_METRICS\" value: \"true\" Copy Caution Disabling kube-state-metrics also disables data collection for the following: ReplicaSets DaemonSets StatefulSets Namespaces Deployments Services Endpoints Pods (that are pending) Additionally, disabling this affects the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer in the following ways: No pending pods are shown. No filters based on services. Specify the kube-state-metrics URL If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, uncomment and configure the following lines to specify which one to use: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL\" value: \"http://KUBE_STATE_METRICS_IP_OR_FQDN:PORT\" Copy Important Even though a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is defined, the KSM service should contain one of the following labels for the auto-discovery process: k8s-app=kube-state-metrics OR app=kube-state-metrics OR ​​app.kubernetes.io/name=kube-state-metrics Important This configuration option overrides KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL has no effect. Discover kube-state-metrics pods using a label If several instances of kube-state-metrics are present in the cluster, another option to easily target one of these instances with the Kubernetes integration is to use label-based discovery. - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL\" value: \"LABEL_NAME\" Copy Important When a KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL is defined, the label should have a value equal to true. For example, if the label name is my-ksm, ensure that my-ksm=true. Important This configuration option is incompatible with KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL. If you have both defined, KUBE_STATE_METRICS_URL is used. Query kube-state-metrics behind RBAC If your instance of kube-state-metrics is behind kube-rbac-proxy, the integration can be configured in a compatible way using the combination of the label-based discovery and two other environment variables: - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_SCHEME\" value: \"https\" - name: \"KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT\" value: \"KSM_RBAC_PROXY_PORT\" Copy To confirm which port should be used as the value of KUBE_STATE_METRICS_PORT, we recommend running a describe command on the kube-state-metrics pod and look for the port exposed by the container named kube-rbac-proxy-main. Important These two configuration options only work when using the KUBE_STATE_METRICS_POD_LABEL configuration described above. kube-state-metrics timeout: Increase the client timeout To increase the client timeout of kube-state-metrics, add a new environment variable, TIMEOUT, to the manifest file: env: - name: TIMEOUT value: 5000 # The default client timeout when calling kube-state-metrics, in milliseconds Copy Then, add this new environment variable to the NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT Non-default namespace deployments: Edit config file If you want to deploy in a different namespace from default, change all values of namespace in the manifest. Set the TTL for the Kubernetes API responses cache By default, the integration will cache any retrieved information from the Kubernetes API for 5 minutes. Use the API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL environment variable to set a custom cache duration for responses from the API server. Valid time unit values are: ns, us, ms, s, m, and h. To disable caching, set to 0s. env: - name: API_SERVER_CACHE_TTL value: \"1m\" Copy Specify base URLs for control plane component endpoints Use the following environment variables if any of the Kubernetes control plane components export metrics on base URLs that are different from the defaults. This is necessary for environments such as OpenShift when a control plane component metrics endpoint is using SSL or an alternate port. Values of these environment variables must be base URLs of the form [scheme]://[host]:[port]. URLs should not include a path component. For example: - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259\" - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy The /metrics path segment is added automatically. In addition, if the https scheme is used, authentication to the control plane component pod(s) is accomplished via service accounts. Caution If a FQDN (fully qualified domain name) is used in a multi-master cluster, inconsistent results may be returned. Therefore, it is recommended to use localhost only. Important Even though a custom base URL is defined for a given control plane component, the control plane component pod(s) must contain one of the labels supported by the auto-discovery process. Important Even though a custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL can be defined, ETCD will always require https and mTLS authentication to be configured. Here are some additional configurations to consider: Do more configuration for control plane monitoring Link New Relic APM to the Kubernetes integration Monitor services that run on Kubernetes Configure the infrastructure agent The Kubernetes integration image comes with a default configurations for the agent that can be modified if needed. When installing with the manifest, you can modify the infrastructure agent configuration by editing the manifest and adding any needed configuration option of the agent as environment variables of the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. When installing with Helm, you can specify the needed infrastructure agent configuration options in the values.yaml as shown in the example in GitHub. The config object is used to populate the configMap that is mounted automatically in the location of the infrastructure agent configuration file in the pods created by the newrelic-infrastructure DaemonSet. Update to the latest version Using the automated installer To update a Kubernetes integration installed with the automated installer, just run the installer again. It will always offer a manifest pointing to the last released version of the integration. Using helm See Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm Custom manifest If you are already running the Kubernetes integration and want to update the newrelic-infra agent to the latest agent version: Run this NRQL query to check which version you are currently running (this will return the image name by cluster): SELECT latest(containerImage) FROM K8sContainerSample WHERE containerImage LIKE '%newrelic/infrastructure%' FACET clusterName SINCE 1 day ago Copy If you've set a name other than newrelic/infrastructure for the integration's container image, the above query won't yield results: to make it work, edit the name in the query. Download the integration manifest file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Copy the changes you made to the manifest. At a minimum, include CLUSTER_NAME and NRIA_LICENSE_KEY, and paste your changes in the manifest you downloaded. Install the latest DaemonSet with the following command (Kubernetes will automatically do a rollout upgrade for the integration's pods): kubectl apply -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy Uninstall the Kubernetes integration To uninstall the Kubernetes integration: Verify that newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml corresponds to the filename of the manifest as you have saved it. Example: If you are using the unprivileged version of the integration, the default filename will be newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-unprivileged-latest.yaml. After you verify the filename, use the following command: kubectl delete -f newrelic-infrastructure-k8s-latest.yaml Copy You only need to execute this command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster.",

Get the infrastructure agent version For the Kubernetes integration, the infrastructure agent is distributed as a Docker image that contains the infrastructure agent and the Kubernetes integration. The Docker image is tagged with a version, and the infrastructure agent also has its own version. When the agent is successfully sending information to New Relic, you can retrieve the versions of the infrastructure agent for Kubernetes (the Docker image) you are running in your clusters by using the following NRQL query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName = 'newrelic-infra' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy If the agent is not reporting any data: Get the version(s) of the New Relic integration for Kubernetes that you are running in a cluster using kubectl: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -l name=newrelic-infra -o jsonpath=\"{.items..spec..containers..image}\" Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic/infrastructure-k8s:1.0.0 Copy Get kube-state-metrics version To retrieve the version of kube-state-metrics running on your clusters, run the following NRQL query: FROM K8sContainerSample SELECT uniqueCount(entityId) WHERE containerName LIKE '%kube-state-metrics%' facet clusterName, containerImage Copy Get logs from pods connecting to kube-state-metrics To get the logs from pods connecting to kube-state-metrics: Get the nodes that kube-state-metrics is running on: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide | grep kube-state-metrics Copy Look for output similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-pclhh 2/2 Running 4 4d 172.17.0.3 minikube Copy Get the New Relic pods that are running on the same node as kube-state-metrics: kubectl describe node minikube | grep newrelic-infra Copy Look for output similar to this: default newrelic-infra-5wcv6 100m (5%) 0 (0%) 100Mi (5%) 100Mi (5%) Copy Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-5wcv6 Copy Retrieve kube-state-metrics service configuration To retrieve the configuration: Run: kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep \"kube-state-metrics\" Copy Look for a response similar to this: kube-system kube-state-metrics-5c6f5cb9b5-5wf9m 2/2 Running 8 6d Copy Review the namespace in the first column. kubectl describe service kube-state-metrics -n <namespace> Copy Get logs from pod running on a master node To get the logs from a pod running on a master node: Get the nodes that are labelled as master: kubectl get nodes -l node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" Copy Or, kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/role=\"master\" Copy Look for output similar to this: NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal Ready master 42d v1.14.8 Copy Get the New Relic pods that are running on one of the nodes returned in the previous step: kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=ip-10-42-24-4.ec2.internal -l name=newrelic-infra --all-namespaces Copy Look for output similar to this: newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy Retrieve the logs for the nodes by running: kubectl logs newrelic-infra-whvzt Copy For troubleshooting help, see Not seeing data or Error messages.
