You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic Node.js agent installation. Add Node.js data Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting After you update the agent, generate some traffic and wait a few minutes. If no data appears in the New Relic UI, see the troubleshooting procedures.",

      "body": "You can use our Node.js agent to instrument Node.js applications deployed in Docker containers. This document explains how to build, configure, and deploy your Dockerized Node.js application that has been instrumented with New Relic. Instrument your container With just a few additions your existing Dockerfile can be used with our Node.js agent. You'll configure the agent by running your new Docker image with environment variables set. Add newrelic to your package.json: \"newrelic\": \"latest\", Copy Install a specific version, or use any of the other options provided by the package.json format. Check the Node.js agent release notes for information about past agent versions. In the first line of your app's main module, add require('newrelic');. Add this line to your Dockerfile so the agent can run without a configuration file: ENV NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE=true Copy Build your Docker image the way you normally do. To run your Docker app with the agent enabled, add your license key and app name to your docker run command as environment variables: docker run -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ -e NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"Your Application Name\" \\ your_image_name:latest Copy Other configuration options Caution Do not include your license key in your Dockerfile or Docker image. For more information, see our documentation on license key security. In addition to setting your application name or license key, you can set other configuration options by starting your container with the -e option. For example, to enable distributed tracing, use: $ docker run -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \\ -e NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"Your Application Name\" \\ -e NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true \\ your_image_name:latest Copy You can also set configuration options in your Dockerfile using ENV directives: ENV NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true \\ NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout # etc. Copy",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Important The license_key setting is required. We highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array Default 404 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the New Relic APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for span events. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent to span events regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with span events. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language Agents: Configure Distributed Tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Add Node.js data Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes.

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process.

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 8 Before upgrading to Node.js version 8, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v8 Comments Added official parity support for Node 16. BREAKING: Dropped Node v10.x support. For further information see our support policy. BREAKING: Removed serverless_mode as a feature flag. The standard serverless_mode configuration still exists. BREAKING: The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle automatically when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, you may leverage a feature-flag to temporarily restore this functionality. Example configuration: feature_flag: { certificate_bundle: true }. In this case, we recommend getting a certificate bundle for your environment such as the one from Mozilla. The New Relic bundle and feature flag will be fully removed in next major release. Defaulted config.feature_flags.certificate_bundle to false. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v4.0.1 @newrelic/koa v6.0.1 @newrelic/native-metrics v7.0.1 @newrelic/superagent v5.0.1 @newrelic/test-utilities v6.0.0 Node version support Node v12 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v8 agent. Node 10 and 11 are not supported by v8. Customers running Node 11 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v8 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v7 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 12. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 does not receive updates. Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. Support for Node 10 has been discontinued with the New Relic Node.js agent v8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process.

For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 8 Before upgrading to Node.js version 8, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v8 Comments Added official parity support for Node 16. BREAKING: Dropped Node v10.x support. For further information see our support policy. BREAKING: Removed serverless_mode as a feature flag. The standard serverless_mode configuration still exists. BREAKING: The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle automatically when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, you may leverage a feature-flag to temporarily restore this functionality. Example configuration: feature_flag: { certificate_bundle: true }. In this case, we recommend getting a certificate bundle for your environment such as the one from Mozilla. The New Relic bundle and feature flag will be fully removed in next major release. Defaulted config.feature_flags.certificate_bundle to false. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v4.0.1 @newrelic/koa v6.0.1 @newrelic/native-metrics v7.0.1 @newrelic/superagent v5.0.1 @newrelic/test-utilities v6.0.0 Node version support Node v12 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v8 agent. Node 10 and 11 are not supported by v8. Customers running Node 11 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v8 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v7 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 12. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true.

Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 does not receive updates. Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. Support for Node 10 has been discontinued with the New Relic Node.js agent v8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process.

For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 8 Before upgrading to Node.js version 8, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v8 Comments Added official parity support for Node 16. BREAKING: Dropped Node v10.x support. For further information see our support policy. BREAKING: Removed serverless_mode as a feature flag. The standard serverless_mode configuration still exists. BREAKING: The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle automatically when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, you may leverage a feature-flag to temporarily restore this functionality. Example configuration: feature_flag: { certificate_bundle: true }. In this case, we recommend getting a certificate bundle for your environment such as the one from Mozilla. The New Relic bundle and feature flag will be fully removed in next major release. Defaulted config.feature_flags.certificate_bundle to false.

Node 10 and 11 are not supported by v8. Customers running Node 11 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v8 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v7 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 12. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true.

Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data.

For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 8 Before upgrading to Node.js version 8, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v8 Comments Added official parity support for Node 16. BREAKING: Dropped Node v10.x support. For further information see our support policy. BREAKING: Removed serverless_mode as a feature flag. The standard serverless_mode configuration still exists. BREAKING: The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle automatically when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, you may leverage a feature-flag to temporarily restore this functionality. Example configuration: feature_flag: { certificate_bundle: true }. In this case, we recommend getting a certificate bundle for your environment such as the one from Mozilla. The New Relic bundle and feature flag will be fully removed in next major release. Defaulted config.feature_flags.certificate_bundle to false. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v4.0.1 @newrelic/koa v6.0.1 @newrelic/native-metrics v7.0.1 @newrelic/superagent v5.0.1 @newrelic/test-utilities v6.0.0 Node version support Node v12 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v8 agent. Node 10 and 11 are not supported by v8. Customers running Node 11 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v8 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v7 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 12. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 does not receive updates. Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. Support for Node 10 has been discontinued with the New Relic Node.js agent v8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing.

For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 8 Before upgrading to Node.js version 8, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v8 Comments Added official parity support for Node 16. BREAKING: Dropped Node v10.x support. For further information see our support policy. BREAKING: Removed serverless_mode as a feature flag. The standard serverless_mode configuration still exists. BREAKING: The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle automatically when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, you may leverage a feature-flag to temporarily restore this functionality. Example configuration: feature_flag: { certificate_bundle: true }. In this case, we recommend getting a certificate bundle for your environment such as the one from Mozilla. The New Relic bundle and feature flag will be fully removed in next major release. Defaulted config.feature_flags.certificate_bundle to false.

BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 does not receive updates. Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. Support for Node 10 has been discontinued with the New Relic Node.js agent v8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier.

Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search.

Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance. To redirect New Relic Java agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.ymlfile to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership.

Your hosting provider may allow or provide installation for common web apps/frameworks (such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc), but installing the PHP agent still requires permissions not allowed in many basic plans. If necessary, contact your website developer/hosting provider for technical assistance. Shared hosting services In general, shared hosting providers (who do not provide root command line access) and hosting providers that do not have traditional operating systems (such as PaaS) do not allow users to install New Relic agents through typical channels. For example, these hosting providers do not support New Relic integrations for certain subscription levels: DreamHost: Shared Web Hosting WordPress.com hosted blog GoDaddy: Economy, Deluxe, Ultimate, WordPress Blog Hosting HostGator Web Hosting Before you install New Relic's PHP agent, make sure your hosting service level is compatible with New Relic. Also make sure you have administrator permissions for installation procedures from the command line at the root level. Installation and troubleshooting tips To help ensure that your application can integrate successfully with New Relic: Make sure your system meets New Relic's PHP compatibility requirements. Important Windows operating systems are not supported. Follow New Relic's PHP installation procedures. If your system meets New Relic's compatibility requirements but your installation is unsuccessful, gather the following information: Exact steps you tried Results, including success or failure messages Your operating system and version (for example, Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 64-bit) Your hosting service provider and subscription level If applicable, contact your website developer for assistance.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

For a more flexible method to create key/value pairs, use newrelic_add_custom_parameter. As of release 4.4, calling newrelic_set_user_attributes(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); is equivalent to calling newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"user\", \"a\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"account\", \"b\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"product\", \"c\"); All three parameters are required, but they may be empty strings. Parameters Parameter Description $user_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify a name or username to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the user key. $account_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a user account to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the account key. $product_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a product to associate with this page view.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters.

If you want to limit the destinations that you capture parameters for, see Selecting specific destinations. Configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* Copy Capture only specific request parameters To capture only specific request parameters, you can pass a list to attributes.include: Configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.user_id request.parameters.product_id Copy Disabling all attributes In this example, attributes are disabled, so the include and exclude lists will be ignored and all attributes will be filtered out.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header).

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ...

Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ...

If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "The PHP agent captures special metrics for Drupal websites. When these metrics are collected, a Drupal tab appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Drupal app). Configuration The collection of Drupal-specific metrics can be controlled by newrelic.framework.drupal.modules. It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the browser monitoring JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the browser monitoring JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the browser monitoring JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name.

If necessary, contact your website developer/hosting provider for technical assistance. Shared hosting services In general, shared hosting providers (who do not provide root command line access) and hosting providers that do not have traditional operating systems (such as PaaS) do not allow users to install New Relic agents through typical channels. For example, these hosting providers do not support New Relic integrations for certain subscription levels: DreamHost: Shared Web Hosting WordPress.com hosted blog GoDaddy: Economy, Deluxe, Ultimate, WordPress Blog Hosting HostGator Web Hosting Before you install New Relic's PHP agent, make sure your hosting service level is compatible with New Relic. Also make sure you have administrator permissions for installation procedures from the command line at the root level. Installation and troubleshooting tips To help ensure that your application can integrate successfully with New Relic: Make sure your system meets New Relic's PHP compatibility requirements.

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. These are the standard procedures to install our PHP agent on Ubuntu or Debian. (This is not the same as the Ubuntu and Debian procedures for the infrastructure monitoring agent.) For other situations, see the PHP agent procedures for non-standard PHP installations. PHP versions The package name for the PHP agent is newrelic-php5. Although the name references PHP 5, this package works for all supported PHP versions, including PHP 7 versions. Recommended: Use apt This is the recommended method for New Relic installation and maintenance. Important Run the commands in this procedure as root. Step Notes 1. Configure the New Relic apt repository. echo 'deb http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/ newrelic non-free' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic.list Copy This command adds deb http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/ newrelic non-free to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic.list. It creates the file if it does not exist. This step is only required once per system. 2. Trust the New Relic GPG key. This step is required to register New Relic as an authenticated source where apt-get will look for new packages. To get the New Relic public apt-key from global key servers, run the following command as root: wget -O- https://download.newrelic.com/548C16BF.gpg | sudo apt-key add - Copy If you do not run this command as root, you may see an error message about the public key. 3. Update the local package list. Execute the following command as root: sudo apt-get update Copy 4. Install the PHP agent. Execute the following command to install directly from the New Relic repositories: sudo apt-get install newrelic-php5 Copy 5. Non-standard installations: Complete installation manually. If you are not using the default Ubuntu or Debian PHP packages, the newrelic-php5 package may be unable to configure PHP automatically. You may see this error: Please run newrelic-install as root to complete installation. Copy If so, run the following command: sudo newrelic-install install Copy 6. Configure your application name and New Relic license key. The installation process prompts for your application name and license key. Your license key appears in the account information section of Account settings. For headless installations, you can also preseed your license key and application name by using debconf. 7. Restart your web server or FastCGI Process Manager (FPM). Generate traffic for your app, and wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Optional: Unattended installation To run an unattended installation, you can use non-interactive mode. Include the -y flag to automatically respond yes to any prompt during package installation. For example: DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install newrelic-php5 Copy Manual: Use dpkg Important If you use dpkg, you must manually install updates. This is why New Relic recommends the apt method for installation and maintenance. Run the commands in this procedure as root. To install the PHP agent manually using dpkg: Step Notes 1. Copy the URL for the package download. Navigate to the appropriate URL for your architecture, and copy the full URL for the latest newrelic-daemon, newrelic-php5-common, and newrelic-php5 packages: 32-bit architecture 64-bit architecture 2. Download the package. Run the following wget command, replacing https://LINK_TO_PACKAGE with the full URL of the package: wget -L https://LINK_TO_PACKAGE Copy 3. Install the PHP agent. Run the appropriate command as root, replacing X.X.X.X with the current version: 32-bit: dpkg -i newrelic-php5-common_X.X.X.X_all.deb newrelic-daemon_X.X.X.X_i386.deb newrelic-php5_X.X.X.X_i386.deb Copy 64-bit: dpkg -i newrelic-php5-common_X.X.X.X_all.deb newrelic-daemon_X.X.X.X_amd64.deb newrelic-php5_X.X.X.X_amd64.deb Copy 4. Configure your application name and New Relic license key. The installation process prompts for your application name and license key. Your license key appears in the account information section of Account settings. For headless installations, you can also preseed your license key and application name by using debconf. 5. Restart your web server or FastCGI Process Manager (FPM). Generate traffic for your app, and wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Headless: Preseed license key and app name For headless installations, you can preseed your license key and application name. You must use the default php5 packages provided by your distribution. To preseed, set values in your debconf database by using debconf-set-selections. Important These settings will be ignored if you are not using a packaged PHP. You will be prompted to run newrelic-install. These keys are located in the newrelic-php5 package: Name Type newrelic-php5/application-name Copy The name of your app. This string sets newrelic.appname in your newrelic.ini. string newrelic-php5/license-key Copy Your New Relic license key. This string sets newrelic.license in your newrelic.ini. string For example, you can run these commands to preseed your app name and license key: echo newrelic-php5 newrelic-php5/application-name string \"My App Name\" | debconf-set-selections echo newrelic-php5 newrelic-php5/license-key string \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | debconf-set-selections Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

      "body": "You can install New Relic's PHP agent from compressed tar files on any supported platform. However, for Redhat or CentOS it is more common to use the RPM package. For Ubuntu or Debian it is more common to use the Debian package. Download the tar distribution Unlike other installation options, tar archives do not require any special repository setup. All you need to do is download the archive and follow these instructions. Download the appropriate tar distribution file from download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. For example: For FreeBSD, download newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-freebsd.tar.gz. For Alpine Linux, download newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-linux-musl.tar.gz. Tip The package name for the New Relic's PHP agent is newrelic-php5. Although the name references PHP 5, this package works for all supported PHP versions, including PHP 7 versions. Install or update With tar file installation, the steps for first time installation and for updating are the same. Replace X.X.X.X with the correct New Relic version. To install or update the agent: Download the appropriate tar file from the New Relic website, and save it to a local disk in a convenient location. Decompress and extract the archive: gzip -dc newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-OS.tar.gz | tar xf - Copy Change to the newly created directory: cd newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-OS Copy Run the installation script: ./newrelic-install Copy Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Wait a few minutes for your application to send data, then check your app's performance in the New Relic UI.

For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI.

If necessary, contact your website developer/hosting provider for technical assistance. Shared hosting services In general, shared hosting providers (who do not provide root command line access) and hosting providers that do not have traditional operating systems (such as PaaS) do not allow users to install New Relic agents through typical channels. For example, these hosting providers do not support New Relic integrations for certain subscription levels: DreamHost: Shared Web Hosting WordPress.com hosted blog GoDaddy: Economy, Deluxe, Ultimate, WordPress Blog Hosting HostGator Web Hosting Before you install New Relic's PHP agent, make sure your hosting service level is compatible with New Relic. Also make sure you have administrator permissions for installation procedures from the command line at the root level. Installation and troubleshooting tips To help ensure that your application can integrate successfully with New Relic: Make sure your system meets New Relic's PHP compatibility requirements.

RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.).

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website.

Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined.

When Distributed Tracing is enabled, newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers will always insert W3C trace context headers. It also, by default, inserts the New Relic Distributed Tracing header, but this can be disabled via the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header INI setting. Parameters Parameter Description $headers array Required. An (optionally empty) array of outbound headers. This argument is passed by reference, and therefore must be a variable as opposed to a literal. Return values True if any headers were successfully inserted into the provided array, otherwise returns False Examples For examples of how and when to use this API method, see the documentation to manually instrument applications and services.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI.

For example, these hosting providers do not support New Relic integrations for certain subscription levels: DreamHost: Shared Web Hosting WordPress.com hosted blog GoDaddy: Economy, Deluxe, Ultimate, WordPress Blog Hosting HostGator Web Hosting Before you install New Relic's PHP agent, make sure your hosting service level is compatible with New Relic. Also make sure you have administrator permissions for installation procedures from the command line at the root level. Installation and troubleshooting tips To help ensure that your application can integrate successfully with New Relic: Make sure your system meets New Relic's PHP compatibility requirements.

If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

      "body": "Problem After installing the New Relic PHP agent, generating some traffic, and waiting at least five minutes, no data appears in your New Relic UI. Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.record_exception(exc=None, value=None, tb=None, params={}, ignore_errors=[], application=None) Copy This API has been deprecated. Please use notice_error(). Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.record_exception(exc=None, value=None, tb=None, params={}, ignore_errors=[], application=None) Copy This API has been deprecated. Please use notice_error(). Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True.
