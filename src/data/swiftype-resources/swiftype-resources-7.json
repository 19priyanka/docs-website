      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services.

Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details.

Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead. Analytics Events New Relic dashboards is a resource to gather and visualize data about your software and what it says about your business. With it you can quickly and easily create real-time dashboards to get immediate answers about end-user experiences, clickstreams, mobile activities, and server transactions. analytics_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_ENABLED If true, enables analytics event sampling. analytics_events.max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1200 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of request events reported from a single harvest. analytics_events.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_events.attributes.enabled instead. Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from browser monitoring. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on span events. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_SEGMENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on transaction segments. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml.

For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent.

Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected.

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead. Analytics Events New Relic dashboards is a resource to gather and visualize data about your software and what it says about your business. With it you can quickly and easily create real-time dashboards to get immediate answers about end-user experiences, clickstreams, mobile activities, and server transactions. analytics_events.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_ENABLED If true, enables analytics event sampling. analytics_events.max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1200 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of request events reported from a single harvest. analytics_events.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_events.attributes.enabled instead. Attributes Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from browser monitoring. span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on span events. transaction_segments.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_SEGMENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes on transaction segments. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

You can configure these two settings independently. Resque versions 1.23.1 or higher If you are running Resque 1.23.1 or higher, you should not need to make any code changes outside of the normal agent installation procedures in order for New Relic's Resque instrumentation to work. Exception: If you have leftover calls to NewRelic::Agent methods from your Resque before_first_fork, before_fork, or after_fork hooks from when you were running an older version of Resque, be sure to remove those calls after upgrading to Resque 1.23.1 or higher. Alternate forking modes The resque-multi-job-forks or resque-jobs-per-fork gems change the forking behavior of Resque so that it will not fork for each individual job, but instead fork once per batch of jobs. Similarly, you can set the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false in order to completely disable forking in Resque. If you use any of these alternate forking modes in your application, make sure you are running Ruby agent version 3.9.7 or higher. Earlier versions of the Ruby agent do not work correctly with these alternate forking modes. If you are upgrading to 3.9.7 or higher, make sure to remove any direct calls to NewRelic::Agent methods such as manual_start or after_fork that you may have previously been using in order to get the agent to work in these environments. Old Resque versions ( < 1.23.1) It is possible to use New Relic's Ruby agent with Resque versions older than 1.23.1. However, New Relic recommends that you upgrade to Resque 1.23.1 or higher for best results. Many applications use the hooks exposed by Resque (before_fork, after_fork, etc.) in order to inject custom code at critical points during the lifetime of Resque jobs. The New Relic Ruby agent also must use these hooks in order to be able to place its instrumentation. Resque versions before 1.23.1 do not allow hooks to be defined multiple times; the last definition will take precedence. If you cannot upgrade to a Resque version >= 1.23.1 (which allows hooks to be defined multiple times without overwriting each other), you can modify your custom Resque hooks by adding the necessary New Relic code. Here is an example. Example: Modifying custom Resque hooks You may omit definitions for any hooks that you have no custom code for. They will be automatically installed by the agent in this case. Resque.before_first_fork do # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:dispatcher => :resque, :sync_startup => true, :start_channel_listener => true) end Resque.before_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.register_report_channel(job.object_id) end Resque.after_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.after_fork(:report_to_channel => job.object_id, :report_instance_busy => false) end Copy Deadlocking jobs Some customers (particularly those with very high job throughput) have reported intermittent deadlocks in their Resque worker processes with the Ruby agent enabled. These deadlocks are due to a bad interaction between the background thread that the Ruby agent uses to send data to New Relic servers and Resque's forking behavior. Use either of these options to resolve these issues: Disable Resque's forking behavior by setting the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false when spawning Resque processes. Use the resolv-replace library from Ruby's standard library to replace Ruby's native DNS resolution code with a pure Ruby version. The Ruby agent uses a background thread in the Resque master process to send data to the New Relic collector. In some environments, this thread will acquire a native lock during DNS resolution (when resolving the hostnames of New Relic collectors). If this native lock is held by the background thread while the main Resque master process's main thread calls fork to create a child process, it will still be marked as held in the forked child process. However, since fork only copies the calling thread, the background thread that was holding the native lock will not exist in the child process, and thus the native lock will never be released. If the child process attempts to do any DNS resolution, it will attempt to acquire the same native lock and deadlock. To avoid this Github issue, use resolv-replace instead of Ruby's default DNS resolution path.",

If the child process attempts to do any DNS resolution, it will attempt to acquire the same native lock and deadlock. To avoid this Github issue, use resolv-replace instead of Ruby's default DNS resolution path.",

Enable Rake support To instrument your app's Rake tasks, add the names of the target tasks to the rake.tasks element in your newrelic.yml file.

Example: Instrumenting two Rake tasks For example, to instrument the Rake tasks deploy and deploy:all, add the following to your newrelic.yml file: rake: tasks: [\"deploy\", \"deploy:all\"] Copy Since task name matching is with regex, you can instrument all of your app's Rake tasks by using a wildcard regex like [\".+\"].

      "body": "Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the Transactions page in APM as Non-web transactions. Supported frameworks The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent: Resque instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.4.0) Sidekiq instrumentation (Ruby agent 3.6.0) Delayed::Job instrumentation (Ruby agent 2.10) Important JRuby users may see issues with CPU metrics. If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions. To monitor Non-web transactions while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive below the method definition Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end Copy You can pass a string to the :category, but values will only appear on the APM Transactions page if the string begins with OtherTransaction/. Monitor custom background methods Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the Non-web transactions. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions. To instrument a class method, use the class singleton. As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

You can configure these two settings independently. Resque versions 1.23.1 or higher If you are running Resque 1.23.1 or higher, you should not need to make any code changes outside of the normal agent installation procedures in order for New Relic's Resque instrumentation to work. Exception: If you have leftover calls to NewRelic::Agent methods from your Resque before_first_fork, before_fork, or after_fork hooks from when you were running an older version of Resque, be sure to remove those calls after upgrading to Resque 1.23.1 or higher. Alternate forking modes The resque-multi-job-forks or resque-jobs-per-fork gems change the forking behavior of Resque so that it will not fork for each individual job, but instead fork once per batch of jobs. Similarly, you can set the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false in order to completely disable forking in Resque. If you use any of these alternate forking modes in your application, make sure you are running Ruby agent version 3.9.7 or higher. Earlier versions of the Ruby agent do not work correctly with these alternate forking modes. If you are upgrading to 3.9.7 or higher, make sure to remove any direct calls to NewRelic::Agent methods such as manual_start or after_fork that you may have previously been using in order to get the agent to work in these environments. Old Resque versions ( < 1.23.1) It is possible to use New Relic's Ruby agent with Resque versions older than 1.23.1. However, New Relic recommends that you upgrade to Resque 1.23.1 or higher for best results. Many applications use the hooks exposed by Resque (before_fork, after_fork, etc.) in order to inject custom code at critical points during the lifetime of Resque jobs. The New Relic Ruby agent also must use these hooks in order to be able to place its instrumentation. Resque versions before 1.23.1 do not allow hooks to be defined multiple times; the last definition will take precedence. If you cannot upgrade to a Resque version >= 1.23.1 (which allows hooks to be defined multiple times without overwriting each other), you can modify your custom Resque hooks by adding the necessary New Relic code. Here is an example. Example: Modifying custom Resque hooks You may omit definitions for any hooks that you have no custom code for. They will be automatically installed by the agent in this case. Resque.before_first_fork do # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:dispatcher => :resque, :sync_startup => true, :start_channel_listener => true) end Resque.before_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.register_report_channel(job.object_id) end Resque.after_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.after_fork(:report_to_channel => job.object_id, :report_instance_busy => false) end Copy Deadlocking jobs Some customers (particularly those with very high job throughput) have reported intermittent deadlocks in their Resque worker processes with the Ruby agent enabled. These deadlocks are due to a bad interaction between the background thread that the Ruby agent uses to send data to New Relic servers and Resque's forking behavior. Use either of these options to resolve these issues: Disable Resque's forking behavior by setting the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false when spawning Resque processes. Use the resolv-replace library from Ruby's standard library to replace Ruby's native DNS resolution code with a pure Ruby version. The Ruby agent uses a background thread in the Resque master process to send data to the New Relic collector. In some environments, this thread will acquire a native lock during DNS resolution (when resolving the hostnames of New Relic collectors). If this native lock is held by the background thread while the main Resque master process's main thread calls fork to create a child process, it will still be marked as held in the forked child process. However, since fork only copies the calling thread, the background thread that was holding the native lock will not exist in the child process, and thus the native lock will never be released. If the child process attempts to do any DNS resolution, it will attempt to acquire the same native lock and deadlock. To avoid this Github issue, use resolv-replace instead of Ruby's default DNS resolution path.",

As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called SalesOrganization#find_new_leads. Add the ControllerInstrumentation module below the method definition. Use the add_transaction_tracer directive Add :category => :task to tell the agent this trace is a Non-web transaction. require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization def self.find_new_leads ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end end Copy For more information, see Ruby custom metrics. Monitor short-lived processes Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior. Use manual_start and pass in the :sync_startup => true option: require 'new_relic/agent' NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true) Copy Using require 'new_relic/agent' will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it. If the process is shorter than the agent harvest cycle, you need to manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown to ensure all queued data is sent. Configure newrelic.yml for background processes Configuring your newrelic.yml depends on the context of the background application. Non-Rails background application If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your newrelic.yml file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the config subdirectory. Make sure it includes your license key. Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the RUBY_ENV, RAILS_ENV, and RACK_ENV environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to development if none of these environment variables are set. Background job environment monitored by New Relic If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing newrelic.yml file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the RAILS_ENV environment variable in order to determine which section of the newrelic.yml file to read. Report to an alternate application name You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a different application name in the APM UI. Begin before newrelic_rpm gets required by your worker code. Set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the app_name setting in your newrelic.yml. $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"My Background Jobs\" ./bin/my_background_worker.rb Copy Ensure the agent starts The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you require 'newrelic_rpm', unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions. Non-Rails standalone script Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they require 'newrelic_rpm'. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this require call until after the initial setup finishes. Background tasks with daemons gem If you use the daemons gem to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to / before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process. To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example: ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../config/newrelic.yml' ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log' Copy For more information, see the documentation about controlling agent startup Monitor scripts The agent startup instructions apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with ::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example: require 'newrelic_rpm' class SalesOrganization include ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def find_new_leads ... end add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task end SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads ::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Ruby custom metrics (method tracers, metric names, stats, examples Ruby agent API (public API methods for the New Relic Ruby agent)",

If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration. Monitor custom background jobs You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM Transactions page as Non-web transactions.

You can configure these two settings independently. Resque versions 1.23.1 or higher If you are running Resque 1.23.1 or higher, you should not need to make any code changes outside of the normal agent installation procedures in order for New Relic's Resque instrumentation to work. Exception: If you have leftover calls to NewRelic::Agent methods from your Resque before_first_fork, before_fork, or after_fork hooks from when you were running an older version of Resque, be sure to remove those calls after upgrading to Resque 1.23.1 or higher. Alternate forking modes The resque-multi-job-forks or resque-jobs-per-fork gems change the forking behavior of Resque so that it will not fork for each individual job, but instead fork once per batch of jobs. Similarly, you can set the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false in order to completely disable forking in Resque. If you use any of these alternate forking modes in your application, make sure you are running Ruby agent version 3.9.7 or higher. Earlier versions of the Ruby agent do not work correctly with these alternate forking modes. If you are upgrading to 3.9.7 or higher, make sure to remove any direct calls to NewRelic::Agent methods such as manual_start or after_fork that you may have previously been using in order to get the agent to work in these environments. Old Resque versions ( < 1.23.1) It is possible to use New Relic's Ruby agent with Resque versions older than 1.23.1. However, New Relic recommends that you upgrade to Resque 1.23.1 or higher for best results. Many applications use the hooks exposed by Resque (before_fork, after_fork, etc.) in order to inject custom code at critical points during the lifetime of Resque jobs. The New Relic Ruby agent also must use these hooks in order to be able to place its instrumentation. Resque versions before 1.23.1 do not allow hooks to be defined multiple times; the last definition will take precedence. If you cannot upgrade to a Resque version >= 1.23.1 (which allows hooks to be defined multiple times without overwriting each other), you can modify your custom Resque hooks by adding the necessary New Relic code. Here is an example. Example: Modifying custom Resque hooks You may omit definitions for any hooks that you have no custom code for. They will be automatically installed by the agent in this case. Resque.before_first_fork do # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:dispatcher => :resque, :sync_startup => true, :start_channel_listener => true) end Resque.before_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.register_report_channel(job.object_id) end Resque.after_fork do |job| # ... your custom hook code ... NewRelic::Agent.after_fork(:report_to_channel => job.object_id, :report_instance_busy => false) end Copy Deadlocking jobs Some customers (particularly those with very high job throughput) have reported intermittent deadlocks in their Resque worker processes with the Ruby agent enabled. These deadlocks are due to a bad interaction between the background thread that the Ruby agent uses to send data to New Relic servers and Resque's forking behavior. Use either of these options to resolve these issues: Disable Resque's forking behavior by setting the FORK_PER_JOB environment variable to false when spawning Resque processes. Use the resolv-replace library from Ruby's standard library to replace Ruby's native DNS resolution code with a pure Ruby version. The Ruby agent uses a background thread in the Resque master process to send data to the New Relic collector. In some environments, this thread will acquire a native lock during DNS resolution (when resolving the hostnames of New Relic collectors). If this native lock is held by the background thread while the main Resque master process's main thread calls fork to create a child process, it will still be marked as held in the forked child process. However, since fork only copies the calling thread, the background thread that was holding the native lock will not exist in the child process, and thus the native lock will never be released. If the child process attempts to do any DNS resolution, it will attempt to acquire the same native lock and deadlock. To avoid this Github issue, use resolv-replace instead of Ruby's default DNS resolution path.",

This requires: Rake version 10.0.0 or higher Ruby agent version 3.13.0 or higher To instrument Rake tasks, specify the tasks by name in your newrelic.yml file. Enable Rake support To instrument your app's Rake tasks, add the names of the target tasks to the rake.tasks element in your newrelic.yml file. The Ruby agent matches these names against your active tasks using string regex. Example: Instrumenting two Rake tasks For example, to instrument the Rake tasks deploy and deploy:all, add the following to your newrelic.yml file: rake: tasks: [\"deploy\", \"deploy:all\"] Copy Since task name matching is with regex, you can instrument all of your app's Rake tasks by using a wildcard regex like [\".+\"]. However, this will not include Rake tasks that are in your deny list by default from the autostart.blacklisted_rake_tasks configuration setting, such as db:migrate. To include any Rake tasks that are in your deny list by default, include them in your customized deny list. To ensure the tasks are instrumented before they run if you are using Rails but your Rake task does not require the Rails environment, add require 'tasks/newrelic' to the top of the Rake tasks. Remove newrelic-rake when appropriate The newrelic-rake third-party gem provides Rake instrumentation support as an add-on to the Ruby agent. If the agent detects newrelic-rake, it will not install the built-in Rake instrumentation, but it will record a log message like this at startup: INFO : Not installing New Relic supported Rake instrumentation because the third party newrelic-rake gem is present Copy Caution Removing the newrelic-rake gem in favor of the built-in instrumentation will change your transaction names. To preserve your existing transaction names, ignore the log message and do not uninstall the gem. To switch to New Relic's built-in Rake instrumentation and change your transaction names: Remove the newrelic-rake gem. Specify the tasks you want to instrument in your config file.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "These instructions are for installing the Ruby agent as a Rails plugin. For most use cases, you should instead install the agent gem. Contents Install the New Relic Rails plugin Important New Relic strongly recommends installing the Ruby agent as a gem in order to have better control over versions and dependencies. To install the Rails plugin from Github, use the following commands for Rails versions 2 or higher: script/plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent Copy This will export the Rails plugin into your application's vendor/plugins directory. If you cannot install the Rails plugin directly from the git URL, you can clone the repository into the vendor/plugins directory. Update the configuration file After installing the agent, copy the newrelic.yml file into the config subdirectory of your application. You can download a fresh newrelic.yml that includes your license key from the Account settings when logged in to New Relic. Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Update the newrelic.yml file Whenever you update the agent, double-check that your Ruby agent configuration file (config/newrelic.yml) is up to date: Open the default newrelic.yml file that lives in the Ruby agent's plugin folder (vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent/newrelic.yml). Look for new configuration options that are not in your config/newrelic.yml file. Update the Ruby agent When using Subversion with the Rails plugin, be sure to remove the old agent plugin before reinstalling. Tip Use the gem if possible. svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"removing old version of newrelic\" Copy Then, to install the latest Ruby agent plugin: script/rails plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn add vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"upgrading newrelic to version X.X.X\" Copy Uninstall the Rails plugin To uninstall the Rails plugin: svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic for Ruby (compatibility and requirements, general information about installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and known issues) Ruby agent installation (using the New Relic Ruby gem and configuration file)",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent allows you to send information about application deployments by using the REST API or a Capistrano recipe (versions 2.x and 3.x) distributed with the Ruby agent. You can then view deployments in the New Relic UI. By default, all deployment information is recorded in your production environment. You can also customize the rails_env variable for other environments, such as staging. Assign an application name To assign an application name: Download the latest version of the Ruby agent. Set the app_name in your newrelic.yml file to a meaningful name. This will assign instances in the given environment the label given by app_name when browsing your data in the New Relic user interface. The deployment upload script will use that label to associate an app with the deployment. Record with the command line If you installed the Ruby agent as a gem, you can record deployments directly by using the newrelic executable: newrelic deployments Copy Depending on your environment, you may need to run: $bundle exec newrelic deployment Copy You can use several optional values with newrelic. The description is short text. deployments [OPTIONS] [description] OPTIONS: -a, --appname=name Set the application name. Default is app_name setting in newrelic.yml -e, --environment=name Override the (RAILS|RUBY)_ENV setting -u, --user=USER Specify the user deploying. -r, --revision=REV Specify the revision being deployed -c, --changes Read in a change log from the standard input -h Print this help Copy When using the -c option, you can pipe the change log into the script. If not piping when using the -c option, select control-D to signify the end of file (EOF). Record with Capistrano 3.x The New Relic Ruby agent contains a Capistrano recipe that can record app deployments. After assigning your app name, edit your Capistrano files to communicate with the agent: At the top of your Capfile, add the following line: require 'new_relic/recipes' Copy In your deploy.rb file, include: after \"deploy:updated\", \"newrelic:notice_deployment\" Copy Record with Capistrano 2.x You can record Capistrano 2.x deployments with the New Relic agent: Tell Capistrano to load New Relic's recipes: If agent was installed with New Relic gem Add this at the top of your deploy.rb file: require 'new_relic/recipes' Copy If agent was installed as Rails plugin In your Capfile, add the following line above load deploy.rb (if it is not already there): Dir['vendor/plugins/*/recipes/*.rb'].each { |plugin| load(plugin) } Copy Add the following hooks to your deploy.rb file: # Notify New Relic of deployments. # This goes out even if the deploy fails, sadly. after \"deploy\", \"newrelic:notice_deployment\" after \"deploy:migrations\", \"newrelic:notice_deployment\" after \"deploy:cold\", \"newrelic:notice_deployment\" Copy The next time you run cap deploy, the agent notifies New Relic of the deployment, and all time series charts will show the deployment event. Customize your Capistrano configuration If Capistrano is running the deployment notification recipe on a remote build machine,the build machine must have your New Relic License key. You can either copy a valid newrelic.yml file to the build machine (possibly using a Capistrano Before Hook) or call set :newrelic_license_key, 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' in your Capistrano configuration. You can customize some deployment information by using Capistrano variables. If defined, these will override the defaults. These apply to both Capistrano 2 and 3. Capistrano 2 and 3 variables Description newrelic_appname The app where the deployment will appear. By default this comes from the definition in the newrelic.yml file for the given rails_env. If you set this value from the command line, you can only specify one application name. If you set this value in newrelic.yml, only the first application name will be used. newrelic_changelog The change log, which is determined by running the svn/git log command from the local working directory where the Capistrano command was issued. newrelic_desc Descriptive text that appears with the deployment. Default is empty. newrelic_license_key The New Relic license key to use. By default this comes from the definition in the newrelic.yml file for the given rails_env. This is not the same as your REST API key. newrelic_revision The revision recorded for the deployment. Recommendation: If you are using Subversion, consider including the tag or branch name in addition to the revision. newrelic_user The user to associate with the deployment. Override Capistrano settings In any version of Capistrano, you can override settings in your deploy.rb: set :newrelic_user, \"username\" Copy To override settings with Capistrano 2.x: From the command line: cap production deploy -Snewrelic_desc=\"Deploying beta Krakatau release\" Copy This example will prompt for content that will appear in the deployment's change log: set(:newrelic_changelog) do Capistrano::CLI.ui.ask \"Enter a summary of changes: \" end Copy Deploy to staging By default, the newrelic_rpm gem comes with Capistrano tasks to record all deployments in your production environment. If you have a separate staging application, you can change the rails_env variable setting so that staging deployments are recorded in the staging app instead of the production app. To identify deployments to your staging environment, use Capistrano or the command line. Deploy to staging Comments Capistrano multistage If you are using Capistrano multistage, add this line to config/deploy/staging.rb: set :rails_env, \"staging\" Copy Capistrano 2.x If you are using Capistrano 2.x, add this information from the command line: cap -s rails_env=staging deployment_task_name Copy",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Annotate transaction traces with nodes for each HTTP request. Provide distributed tracing for requests between applications instrumented with New Relic. Supported HTTP client libraries The following HTTP client libraries are currently supported by the Ruby agent: Name Minimum supported version Notes Net::HTTP N/A (part of the Ruby standard library) Also includes libraries built upon Net::HTTP, such as httparty.

See Curb notes. http.rb 0.9.9 Excon notes The Ruby agent supports Excon version 0.19.0 or higher. Excon instrumentation relies on the ability to add an Excon middleware to the :middlewares key of Excon.defaults, so if your application modifies Excon.defaults you should ensure that you preserve the value of the :middlewares key. Typhoeus notes The Ruby agent supports Typhoeus version 0.5.3 or higher. Parallel requests made via the Hydra mechanism in Typhoeus only have partial distributed tracing support. For such requests, the Ruby agent will record a single transaction trace node representing the entire batch, but you will not be able to see the details about each individual request in the batch.

Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. If you need to continue using cross application tracing, such as for a non-standard middleware framework, see the configuration information in this document. Requirements Follow these requirements to use cross application tracing with the Ruby agent: Make sure the requests being instrumented use a supported HTTP client library. Install or update to the latest Ruby agent (version 3.5.5.38 or higher). Follow the requirements for middleware installation. Middleware installation Cross application tracing works with Rack, and therefore requires Rails 2.3 or greater, or another compatible framework. If you use Rails, the Ruby agent will install the middleware automatically. If you use a different Rack-based framework, manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your stack. Configuration Cross application tracing can be controlled by a configuration flag. As of version 8.0.0 of the Ruby agent, the default for cross_application_tracer.enabled is false, even when unspecified. To enable cross application tracing, you must set this flag to true amd set distributed_tracing.enabled to false. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy For versions below 8.0.0, cross application can be configured using the following setting. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true Copy Cross application trace measurements The external measurement (from the calling application) will always be larger than the internal measurement (from the called application). The external measurement is collected by New Relic's instrumentation of the HTTP client library (such as Net::HTTP). The internal measurement is taken by New Relic's instrumentation of the web framework (such as Rails) in the called application. Here are some of the major components included in the external measurement that are not included in the internal measurement: From calling app to target host DNS time to resolve the target hostname Time to establish a new TCP connection with the target host (TCP 3-way handshake plus SSL negotiation, if SSL is in use) Time spent in the HTTP client library to prepare and serialize the HTTP request Network latency to send the request across the wire to the target host Receiving host Time for the front-end web server on the receiving host to process the request and send it to the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to be parsed in the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to \"percolate\" through Rack middlewares on the receiving host Time for the web framework to route the request to the appropriate controller action Once the web framework has routed it to the appropriate controller action, this is where the internal measurement happens. Then: Time for the request to \"percolate\" back up through the Rack middlewares Network latency to write the response back to the requesting server Time on the requesting host for the HTTP response to be parsed by the HTTP client library Some of these components are easier to control than others. For example, to capture timings for the Receiving host items above, make sure you have request queue monitoring set up on the receiving application.

See Curb notes. http.rb 0.9.9 Excon notes The Ruby agent supports Excon version 0.19.0 or higher. Excon instrumentation relies on the ability to add an Excon middleware to the :middlewares key of Excon.defaults, so if your application modifies Excon.defaults you should ensure that you preserve the value of the :middlewares key. Typhoeus notes The Ruby agent supports Typhoeus version 0.5.3 or higher. Parallel requests made via the Hydra mechanism in Typhoeus only have partial distributed tracing support. For such requests, the Ruby agent will record a single transaction trace node representing the entire batch, but you will not be able to see the details about each individual request in the batch. Cross application tracing does not support requests made via the Hydra mechanism. Testing has shown significant issues with segfaults when running Typhoeus on MRI 1.8.7. Recommendation: Use Ruby Enterprise Edition or MRI 1.9.3 or higher to avoid these problems. Curb notes The Ruby agent supports Curb version 0.8.1 or higher. Curb instrumentation on JRuby is not supported. Requests made via the Curl::Multi API currently only have partial distributed tracing support (equivalent to what is offered for requests made via the Typhoeus Hydra API).

Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. If you need to continue using cross application tracing, such as for a non-standard middleware framework, see the configuration information in this document. Requirements Follow these requirements to use cross application tracing with the Ruby agent: Make sure the requests being instrumented use a supported HTTP client library. Install or update to the latest Ruby agent (version 3.5.5.38 or higher). Follow the requirements for middleware installation. Middleware installation Cross application tracing works with Rack, and therefore requires Rails 2.3 or greater, or another compatible framework. If you use Rails, the Ruby agent will install the middleware automatically. If you use a different Rack-based framework, manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your stack. Configuration Cross application tracing can be controlled by a configuration flag. As of version 8.0.0 of the Ruby agent, the default for cross_application_tracer.enabled is false, even when unspecified. To enable cross application tracing, you must set this flag to true amd set distributed_tracing.enabled to false. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy For versions below 8.0.0, cross application can be configured using the following setting. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true Copy Cross application trace measurements The external measurement (from the calling application) will always be larger than the internal measurement (from the called application). The external measurement is collected by New Relic's instrumentation of the HTTP client library (such as Net::HTTP).

Here are some of the major components included in the external measurement that are not included in the internal measurement: From calling app to target host DNS time to resolve the target hostname Time to establish a new TCP connection with the target host (TCP 3-way handshake plus SSL negotiation, if SSL is in use) Time spent in the HTTP client library to prepare and serialize the HTTP request Network latency to send the request across the wire to the target host Receiving host Time for the front-end web server on the receiving host to process the request and send it to the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to be parsed in the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to \"percolate\" through Rack middlewares on the receiving host Time for the web framework to route the request to the appropriate controller action Once the web framework has routed it to the appropriate controller action, this is where the internal measurement happens. Then: Time for the request to \"percolate\" back up through the Rack middlewares Network latency to write the response back to the requesting server Time on the requesting host for the HTTP response to be parsed by the HTTP client library Some of these components are easier to control than others.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'.

You can also customize the rails_env variable for other environments, such as staging. Assign an application name To assign an application name: Download the latest version of the Ruby agent. Set the app_name in your newrelic.yml file to a meaningful name. This will assign instances in the given environment the label given by app_name when browsing your data in the New Relic user interface. The deployment upload script will use that label to associate an app with the deployment. Record with the command line If you installed the Ruby agent as a gem, you can record deployments directly by using the newrelic executable: newrelic deployments Copy Depending on your environment, you may need to run: $bundle exec newrelic deployment Copy You can use several optional values with newrelic. The description is short text. deployments [OPTIONS] [description] OPTIONS: -a, --appname=name Set the application name. Default is app_name setting in newrelic.yml -e, --environment=name Override the (RAILS|RUBY)_ENV setting -u, --user=USER Specify the user deploying. -r, --revision=REV Specify the revision being deployed -c, --changes Read in a change log from the standard input -h Print this help Copy When using the -c option, you can pipe the change log into the script. If not piping when using the -c option, select control-D to signify the end of file (EOF). Record with Capistrano 3.x The New Relic Ruby agent contains a Capistrano recipe that can record app deployments. After assigning your app name, edit your Capistrano files to communicate with the agent: At the top of your Capfile, add the following line: require 'new_relic/recipes' Copy In your deploy.rb file, include: after \"deploy:updated\", \"newrelic:notice_deployment\" Copy Record with Capistrano 2.x You can record Capistrano 2.x deployments with the New Relic agent: Tell Capistrano to load New Relic's recipes: If agent was installed with New Relic gem Add this at the top of your deploy.rb file: require 'new_relic/recipes' Copy If agent was installed as Rails plugin In your Capfile, add the following line above load deploy.rb (if it is not already there): Dir['vendor/plugins/*/recipes/*.rb'].each { |plugin| load(plugin) } Copy Add the following hooks to your deploy.rb file: # Notify New Relic of deployments. # This goes out even if the deploy fails, sadly. after \"deploy\", \"newrelic:notice_deployment\" after \"deploy:migrations\", \"newrelic:notice_deployment\" after \"deploy:cold\", \"newrelic:notice_deployment\" Copy The next time you run cap deploy, the agent notifies New Relic of the deployment, and all time series charts will show the deployment event. Customize your Capistrano configuration If Capistrano is running the deployment notification recipe on a remote build machine,the build machine must have your New Relic License key. You can either copy a valid newrelic.yml file to the build machine (possibly using a Capistrano Before Hook) or call set :newrelic_license_key, 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' in your Capistrano configuration. You can customize some deployment information by using Capistrano variables. If defined, these will override the defaults. These apply to both Capistrano 2 and 3. Capistrano 2 and 3 variables Description newrelic_appname The app where the deployment will appear. By default this comes from the definition in the newrelic.yml file for the given rails_env. If you set this value from the command line, you can only specify one application name. If you set this value in newrelic.yml, only the first application name will be used. newrelic_changelog The change log, which is determined by running the svn/git log command from the local working directory where the Capistrano command was issued. newrelic_desc Descriptive text that appears with the deployment. Default is empty. newrelic_license_key The New Relic license key to use. By default this comes from the definition in the newrelic.yml file for the given rails_env. This is not the same as your REST API key. newrelic_revision The revision recorded for the deployment. Recommendation: If you are using Subversion, consider including the tag or branch name in addition to the revision. newrelic_user The user to associate with the deployment. Override Capistrano settings In any version of Capistrano, you can override settings in your deploy.rb: set :newrelic_user, \"username\" Copy To override settings with Capistrano 2.x: From the command line: cap production deploy -Snewrelic_desc=\"Deploying beta Krakatau release\" Copy This example will prompt for content that will appear in the deployment's change log: set(:newrelic_changelog) do Capistrano::CLI.ui.ask \"Enter a summary of changes: \" end Copy Deploy to staging By default, the newrelic_rpm gem comes with Capistrano tasks to record all deployments in your production environment. If you have a separate staging application, you can change the rails_env variable setting so that staging deployments are recorded in the staging app instead of the production app. To identify deployments to your staging environment, use Capistrano or the command line. Deploy to staging Comments Capistrano multistage If you are using Capistrano multistage, add this line to config/deploy/staging.rb: set :rails_env, \"staging\" Copy Capistrano 2.x If you are using Capistrano 2.x, add this information from the command line: cap -s rails_env=staging deployment_task_name Copy",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Supported HTTP client libraries The following HTTP client libraries are currently supported by the Ruby agent: Name Minimum supported version Notes Net::HTTP N/A (part of the Ruby standard library) Also includes libraries built upon Net::HTTP, such as httparty. Excon 0.10.1 See Excon notes. Typhoeus 0.5.3 Hydra requests get partial instrumentation, 1.8.7 stability. See Typhoeus notes.

See Curb notes. http.rb 0.9.9 Excon notes The Ruby agent supports Excon version 0.19.0 or higher. Excon instrumentation relies on the ability to add an Excon middleware to the :middlewares key of Excon.defaults, so if your application modifies Excon.defaults you should ensure that you preserve the value of the :middlewares key. Typhoeus notes The Ruby agent supports Typhoeus version 0.5.3 or higher. Parallel requests made via the Hydra mechanism in Typhoeus only have partial distributed tracing support. For such requests, the Ruby agent will record a single transaction trace node representing the entire batch, but you will not be able to see the details about each individual request in the batch. Cross application tracing does not support requests made via the Hydra mechanism. Testing has shown significant issues with segfaults when running Typhoeus on MRI 1.8.7.

Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. If you need to continue using cross application tracing, such as for a non-standard middleware framework, see the configuration information in this document. Requirements Follow these requirements to use cross application tracing with the Ruby agent: Make sure the requests being instrumented use a supported HTTP client library. Install or update to the latest Ruby agent (version 3.5.5.38 or higher). Follow the requirements for middleware installation. Middleware installation Cross application tracing works with Rack, and therefore requires Rails 2.3 or greater, or another compatible framework. If you use Rails, the Ruby agent will install the middleware automatically. If you use a different Rack-based framework, manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your stack. Configuration Cross application tracing can be controlled by a configuration flag. As of version 8.0.0 of the Ruby agent, the default for cross_application_tracer.enabled is false, even when unspecified. To enable cross application tracing, you must set this flag to true amd set distributed_tracing.enabled to false. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy For versions below 8.0.0, cross application can be configured using the following setting. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true Copy Cross application trace measurements The external measurement (from the calling application) will always be larger than the internal measurement (from the called application). The external measurement is collected by New Relic's instrumentation of the HTTP client library (such as Net::HTTP). The internal measurement is taken by New Relic's instrumentation of the web framework (such as Rails) in the called application. Here are some of the major components included in the external measurement that are not included in the internal measurement: From calling app to target host DNS time to resolve the target hostname Time to establish a new TCP connection with the target host (TCP 3-way handshake plus SSL negotiation, if SSL is in use) Time spent in the HTTP client library to prepare and serialize the HTTP request Network latency to send the request across the wire to the target host Receiving host Time for the front-end web server on the receiving host to process the request and send it to the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to be parsed in the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to \"percolate\" through Rack middlewares on the receiving host Time for the web framework to route the request to the appropriate controller action Once the web framework has routed it to the appropriate controller action, this is where the internal measurement happens. Then: Time for the request to \"percolate\" back up through the Rack middlewares Network latency to write the response back to the requesting server Time on the requesting host for the HTTP response to be parsed by the HTTP client library Some of these components are easier to control than others. For example, to capture timings for the Receiving host items above, make sure you have request queue monitoring set up on the receiving application.

Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. If you need to continue using cross application tracing, such as for a non-standard middleware framework, see the configuration information in this document. Requirements Follow these requirements to use cross application tracing with the Ruby agent: Make sure the requests being instrumented use a supported HTTP client library. Install or update to the latest Ruby agent (version 3.5.5.38 or higher). Follow the requirements for middleware installation. Middleware installation Cross application tracing works with Rack, and therefore requires Rails 2.3 or greater, or another compatible framework. If you use Rails, the Ruby agent will install the middleware automatically. If you use a different Rack-based framework, manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your stack. Configuration Cross application tracing can be controlled by a configuration flag. As of version 8.0.0 of the Ruby agent, the default for cross_application_tracer.enabled is false, even when unspecified. To enable cross application tracing, you must set this flag to true amd set distributed_tracing.enabled to false. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy For versions below 8.0.0, cross application can be configured using the following setting. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true Copy Cross application trace measurements The external measurement (from the calling application) will always be larger than the internal measurement (from the called application). The external measurement is collected by New Relic's instrumentation of the HTTP client library (such as Net::HTTP). The internal measurement is taken by New Relic's instrumentation of the web framework (such as Rails) in the called application. Here are some of the major components included in the external measurement that are not included in the internal measurement: From calling app to target host DNS time to resolve the target hostname Time to establish a new TCP connection with the target host (TCP 3-way handshake plus SSL negotiation, if SSL is in use) Time spent in the HTTP client library to prepare and serialize the HTTP request Network latency to send the request across the wire to the target host Receiving host Time for the front-end web server on the receiving host to process the request and send it to the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to be parsed in the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to \"percolate\" through Rack middlewares on the receiving host Time for the web framework to route the request to the appropriate controller action Once the web framework has routed it to the appropriate controller action, this is where the internal measurement happens. Then: Time for the request to \"percolate\" back up through the Rack middlewares Network latency to write the response back to the requesting server Time on the requesting host for the HTTP response to be parsed by the HTTP client library Some of these components are easier to control than others. For example, to capture timings for the Receiving host items above, make sure you have request queue monitoring set up on the receiving application.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "Important As of version 8.0.0 of the Ruby agent, distributed tracing is on by default. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. If you need to continue using cross application tracing, such as for a non-standard middleware framework, see the configuration information in this document. Requirements Follow these requirements to use cross application tracing with the Ruby agent: Make sure the requests being instrumented use a supported HTTP client library. Install or update to the latest Ruby agent (version 3.5.5.38 or higher). Follow the requirements for middleware installation. Middleware installation Cross application tracing works with Rack, and therefore requires Rails 2.3 or greater, or another compatible framework. If you use Rails, the Ruby agent will install the middleware automatically. If you use a different Rack-based framework, manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your stack. Configuration Cross application tracing can be controlled by a configuration flag. As of version 8.0.0 of the Ruby agent, the default for cross_application_tracer.enabled is false, even when unspecified. To enable cross application tracing, you must set this flag to true amd set distributed_tracing.enabled to false. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true distributed_tracing: enabled: false Copy For versions below 8.0.0, cross application can be configured using the following setting. cross_application_tracer: enabled: true Copy Cross application trace measurements The external measurement (from the calling application) will always be larger than the internal measurement (from the called application). The external measurement is collected by New Relic's instrumentation of the HTTP client library (such as Net::HTTP). The internal measurement is taken by New Relic's instrumentation of the web framework (such as Rails) in the called application. Here are some of the major components included in the external measurement that are not included in the internal measurement: From calling app to target host DNS time to resolve the target hostname Time to establish a new TCP connection with the target host (TCP 3-way handshake plus SSL negotiation, if SSL is in use) Time spent in the HTTP client library to prepare and serialize the HTTP request Network latency to send the request across the wire to the target host Receiving host Time for the front-end web server on the receiving host to process the request and send it to the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to be parsed in the back-end web server on the receiving host Time for the request to \"percolate\" through Rack middlewares on the receiving host Time for the web framework to route the request to the appropriate controller action Once the web framework has routed it to the appropriate controller action, this is where the internal measurement happens. Then: Time for the request to \"percolate\" back up through the Rack middlewares Network latency to write the response back to the requesting server Time on the requesting host for the HTTP response to be parsed by the HTTP client library Some of these components are easier to control than others. For example, to capture timings for the Receiving host items above, make sure you have request queue monitoring set up on the receiving application.

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Distributed traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's cross application tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you are using Sinatra, have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above, and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. Important As of version 8.0.0, cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. When enabled, distributed tracing is automatically configured for all rack-based apps without the need for an additional middleware. If you would like to continue using cross application tracing, you will need to update your configuration. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported.

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Distributed traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's cross application tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you are using Sinatra, have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above, and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. Important As of version 8.0.0, cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. When enabled, distributed tracing is automatically configured for all rack-based apps without the need for an additional middleware. If you would like to continue using cross application tracing, you will need to update your configuration. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra.

      "body": "The Ruby agent automatically instruments Rack middlewares. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Rack middlewares, review the resources linked by the Rails on Rack guide. Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Distributed traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's cross application tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you are using Sinatra, have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above, and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. Important As of version 8.0.0, cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. When enabled, distributed tracing is automatically configured for all rack-based apps without the need for an additional middleware. If you would like to continue using cross application tracing, you will need to update your configuration. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

The actions in the UI correspond to the pattern expression used to match them. HTTP operations are not distinguished. Multiple matches are all tracked as separate actions. Contents Getting started To set up Sinatra: Install the latest newrelic_rpm gem. In your Sinatra app, immediately below the Sinatra require directive, add: require 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the configuration definitions in your newrelic.yml file; for example, development, staging, production, etc. Note: Developer mode only works with Rails. Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra. Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.3, New Relic's Sinatra instrumentation works with Padrino versions 0.10.x or higher. Shotgun (not supported) The New Relic Ruby agent will not work with shotgun.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read our docs on our other observability solutions and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby.

A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent.

For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection.

      "body": "These instructions are for installing the Ruby agent as a Rails plugin. For most use cases, you should instead install the agent gem. Contents Install the New Relic Rails plugin Important New Relic strongly recommends installing the Ruby agent as a gem in order to have better control over versions and dependencies. To install the Rails plugin from Github, use the following commands for Rails versions 2 or higher: script/plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent Copy This will export the Rails plugin into your application's vendor/plugins directory. If you cannot install the Rails plugin directly from the git URL, you can clone the repository into the vendor/plugins directory. Update the configuration file After installing the agent, copy the newrelic.yml file into the config subdirectory of your application. You can download a fresh newrelic.yml that includes your license key from the Account settings when logged in to New Relic. Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Update the newrelic.yml file Whenever you update the agent, double-check that your Ruby agent configuration file (config/newrelic.yml) is up to date: Open the default newrelic.yml file that lives in the Ruby agent's plugin folder (vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent/newrelic.yml). Look for new configuration options that are not in your config/newrelic.yml file. Update the Ruby agent When using Subversion with the Rails plugin, be sure to remove the old agent plugin before reinstalling. Tip Use the gem if possible. svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"removing old version of newrelic\" Copy Then, to install the latest Ruby agent plugin: script/rails plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn add vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"upgrading newrelic to version X.X.X\" Copy Uninstall the Rails plugin To uninstall the Rails plugin: svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic for Ruby (compatibility and requirements, general information about installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and known issues) Ruby agent installation (using the New Relic Ruby gem and configuration file)",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "These instructions are for installing the Ruby agent as a Rails plugin. For most use cases, you should instead install the agent gem. Contents Install the New Relic Rails plugin Important New Relic strongly recommends installing the Ruby agent as a gem in order to have better control over versions and dependencies. To install the Rails plugin from Github, use the following commands for Rails versions 2 or higher: script/plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent Copy This will export the Rails plugin into your application's vendor/plugins directory. If you cannot install the Rails plugin directly from the git URL, you can clone the repository into the vendor/plugins directory. Update the configuration file After installing the agent, copy the newrelic.yml file into the config subdirectory of your application. You can download a fresh newrelic.yml that includes your license key from the Account settings when logged in to New Relic. Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Update the newrelic.yml file Whenever you update the agent, double-check that your Ruby agent configuration file (config/newrelic.yml) is up to date: Open the default newrelic.yml file that lives in the Ruby agent's plugin folder (vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent/newrelic.yml). Look for new configuration options that are not in your config/newrelic.yml file. Update the Ruby agent When using Subversion with the Rails plugin, be sure to remove the old agent plugin before reinstalling. Tip Use the gem if possible. svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"removing old version of newrelic\" Copy Then, to install the latest Ruby agent plugin: script/rails plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn add vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"upgrading newrelic to version X.X.X\" Copy Uninstall the Rails plugin To uninstall the Rails plugin: svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic for Ruby (compatibility and requirements, general information about installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and known issues) Ruby agent installation (using the New Relic Ruby gem and configuration file)",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "These instructions are for installing the Ruby agent as a Rails plugin. For most use cases, you should instead install the agent gem. Contents Install the New Relic Rails plugin Important New Relic strongly recommends installing the Ruby agent as a gem in order to have better control over versions and dependencies. To install the Rails plugin from Github, use the following commands for Rails versions 2 or higher: script/plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent Copy This will export the Rails plugin into your application's vendor/plugins directory. If you cannot install the Rails plugin directly from the git URL, you can clone the repository into the vendor/plugins directory. Update the configuration file After installing the agent, copy the newrelic.yml file into the config subdirectory of your application. You can download a fresh newrelic.yml that includes your license key from the Account settings when logged in to New Relic. Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Update the newrelic.yml file Whenever you update the agent, double-check that your Ruby agent configuration file (config/newrelic.yml) is up to date: Open the default newrelic.yml file that lives in the Ruby agent's plugin folder (vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent/newrelic.yml). Look for new configuration options that are not in your config/newrelic.yml file. Update the Ruby agent When using Subversion with the Rails plugin, be sure to remove the old agent plugin before reinstalling. Tip Use the gem if possible. svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"removing old version of newrelic\" Copy Then, to install the latest Ruby agent plugin: script/rails plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn add vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"upgrading newrelic to version X.X.X\" Copy Uninstall the Rails plugin To uninstall the Rails plugin: svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic for Ruby (compatibility and requirements, general information about installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and known issues) Ruby agent installation (using the New Relic Ruby gem and configuration file)",

If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "These instructions are for installing the Ruby agent as a Rails plugin. For most use cases, you should instead install the agent gem. Contents Install the New Relic Rails plugin Important New Relic strongly recommends installing the Ruby agent as a gem in order to have better control over versions and dependencies. To install the Rails plugin from Github, use the following commands for Rails versions 2 or higher: script/plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent Copy This will export the Rails plugin into your application's vendor/plugins directory. If you cannot install the Rails plugin directly from the git URL, you can clone the repository into the vendor/plugins directory. Update the configuration file After installing the agent, copy the newrelic.yml file into the config subdirectory of your application. You can download a fresh newrelic.yml that includes your license key from the Account settings when logged in to New Relic. Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Update the newrelic.yml file Whenever you update the agent, double-check that your Ruby agent configuration file (config/newrelic.yml) is up to date: Open the default newrelic.yml file that lives in the Ruby agent's plugin folder (vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent/newrelic.yml). Look for new configuration options that are not in your config/newrelic.yml file. Update the Ruby agent When using Subversion with the Rails plugin, be sure to remove the old agent plugin before reinstalling. Tip Use the gem if possible. svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"removing old version of newrelic\" Copy Then, to install the latest Ruby agent plugin: script/rails plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn add vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"upgrading newrelic to version X.X.X\" Copy Uninstall the Rails plugin To uninstall the Rails plugin: svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic for Ruby (compatibility and requirements, general information about installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and known issues) Ruby agent installation (using the New Relic Ruby gem and configuration file)",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "These instructions are for installing the Ruby agent as a Rails plugin. For most use cases, you should instead install the agent gem. Contents Install the New Relic Rails plugin Important New Relic strongly recommends installing the Ruby agent as a gem in order to have better control over versions and dependencies. To install the Rails plugin from Github, use the following commands for Rails versions 2 or higher: script/plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent Copy This will export the Rails plugin into your application's vendor/plugins directory. If you cannot install the Rails plugin directly from the git URL, you can clone the repository into the vendor/plugins directory. Update the configuration file After installing the agent, copy the newrelic.yml file into the config subdirectory of your application. You can download a fresh newrelic.yml that includes your license key from the Account settings when logged in to New Relic. Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Update the newrelic.yml file Whenever you update the agent, double-check that your Ruby agent configuration file (config/newrelic.yml) is up to date: Open the default newrelic.yml file that lives in the Ruby agent's plugin folder (vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent/newrelic.yml). Look for new configuration options that are not in your config/newrelic.yml file. Update the Ruby agent When using Subversion with the Rails plugin, be sure to remove the old agent plugin before reinstalling. Tip Use the gem if possible. svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"removing old version of newrelic\" Copy Then, to install the latest Ruby agent plugin: script/rails plugin install git://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent.git vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent mv vendor/plugins/rpm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn add vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins -m \"upgrading newrelic to version X.X.X\" Copy Uninstall the Rails plugin To uninstall the Rails plugin: svn rm vendor/plugins/newrelic-ruby-agent svn commit vendor/plugins Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: New Relic for Ruby (compatibility and requirements, general information about installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and known issues) Ruby agent installation (using the New Relic Ruby gem and configuration file)",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations.

Additionally, the Ruby agent provides some features via Rack middlewares: Distributed traces Auto-instrumentation for browser monitoring New Relic automatically installs these middlewares for Rails and Sinatra. Rack instrumentation The two most common ways to configure Rack middlewares are the Rack::Builder API (most often from config.ru) and Rails' middleware stack configuration: Rack::Builder Middlewares in your config.ru file are configured using Rack::Builder. For the Ruby agent to instrument middlewares from Rack::Builder, your app must run version 1.1.0 or higher of the rack gem. This is the most common use of middlewares with Sinatra or pure-rack applications. Rails middlewares Rails uses its own class (ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack) instead of Rack::Builder to configure middlewares. Even if you haven't explicitly added middlewares to your Rails application, many components of Rails itself are implemented as middleware, so middleware data will appear by default. The Ruby agent automatically instruments middlewares added via ActionDispatch::MiddlewareStack on Rails 3.0 or higher. For more information about configuring middlewares with Rails, see the Ruby on Rails guide. Viewing middleware data You can view middleware data in APM. In the APM Summary page The main chart on your app's APM Summary page includes a purple bar that shows average time per request spent in all Rack middlewares for your application. APM > (selected application) > Summary: Middleware time appears in purple on your app's main Overview chart. In the APM Transactions page You can also see time for individual middlewares for a specific transaction name from your app's APM Transactions page. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction) > Trace details: Here is an example of middleware time for a selected transaction for your app. In APM transaction trace summary Transaction traces also capture detailed middleware call information. APM > (selected application) > Monitor > Transactions > (selected transaction trace): Here is an example of middleware details in a transaction trace. Disabling Rack instrumentation If you do not want to instrument Rack middlewares, you may disable Rack middleware instrumentation with the disable_middleware_instrumentation setting. You can also ignore specific transactions. Installing Ruby agent middlewares manually The Ruby agent's implementation of New Relic's cross application tracing feature uses Rack middleware instrumentation to read and write HTTP headers that are necessary to pass information between monitored applications. If you are using Sinatra, have disabled middleware instrumentation as described above, and want to use cross application tracing, you must manually add the NewRelic::Rack::AgentHooks middleware to your middleware stack. Important As of version 8.0.0, cross application tracing is deprecated in favor of distributed tracing. When enabled, distributed tracing is automatically configured for all rack-based apps without the need for an additional middleware. If you would like to continue using cross application tracing, you will need to update your configuration. Manual Rack instrumentation Earlier versions of the Ruby agent supported manually instrumenting Rack middlewares via the NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::Rack module. This instrumentation is deprecated in Ruby agent versions 3.9.0 or higher, because it is unnecessary with automatic middleware instrumentation. New Relic recommends that you remove references to this module from your code after upgrading to 3.9.0 or higher.",

The actions in the UI correspond to the pattern expression used to match them. HTTP operations are not distinguished. Multiple matches are all tracked as separate actions. Contents Getting started To set up Sinatra: Install the latest newrelic_rpm gem. In your Sinatra app, immediately below the Sinatra require directive, add: require 'newrelic_rpm' Copy Set RACK_ENV to the environment corresponding to the configuration definitions in your newrelic.yml file; for example, development, staging, production, etc. Note: Developer mode only works with Rails. Middleware installation Ruby agent versions prior to 3.6.3 required manual addition of New Relic middlewares to enable certain features, such as cross application tracing and browser monitoring. For more information about required middlewares, see Rack middlewares, or upgrade to the most recent Ruby agent. Ignoring routes Ruby agent versions 3.6.3 or higher support ignoring certain routes, similar to what was previously available in Rails controller instrumentation. To specify these values, use the same style of routes that you use to define your Sinatra application. For example, to ignore a ping route in a Sinatra app, include the following code in the app: newrelic_ignore '/ping' get '/ping' do # ... end Copy If you want an entire application to be ignored (for example, in a mounted application), call newrelic_ignore without parameters: newrelic_ignore Copy Additionally, newrelic_ignore_apdex and newrelic_ignore_enduser are supported. The newrelic_ignore_apdex call will exclude a given route from consideration in overall Apdex calculations. The newrelic_ignore_enduser call will prevent automatic injection of the page load timing JavaScript when a route is rendered. Padrino Padrino is a framework built on top of Sinatra. Starting with Ruby agent version 3.6.3, New Relic's Sinatra instrumentation works with Padrino versions 0.10.x or higher. Shotgun (not supported) The New Relic Ruby agent will not work with shotgun.

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "Here is information about how to use the current service maps feature. For help using the earlier service maps feature, see Legacy APM service maps. Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "Here is information about how to use the current service maps feature. For help using the earlier service maps feature, see Legacy APM service maps. Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby.

Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc .

Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic.

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "Here is information about how to use the current service maps feature. For help using the earlier service maps feature, see Legacy APM service maps. Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer.

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent automatically collects many metrics. It also includes an API you can use to collect additional metrics about your application. If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions. Method tracers are software probes you can put on a method of any class. The probes use module prepending to insert themselves when the target methods execute and gather custom instrumentation on their performance. Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "Here is information about how to use the current service maps feature. For help using the earlier service maps feature, see Legacy APM service maps. Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

Tracing in class definitions Method tracers can be used within normal class definitions, as long as the target method has been defined first: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy To instrument a class method, add the method tracer in the class singleton: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo def self.generate_image ... end class << self include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end end Copy add_method_tracer takes an optional metric name and a hash of options. For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Tracing initializers For Rails, a common way to add instrumentation is to create an initializer and \"monkey patch\" the instrumentation directives. For example, to add a method tracer to MyCache#get: Make sure the MyCache class is loaded before adding the method tracer. Add the following in a file named config/initializers/rpm_instrumentation.rb: require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' MyCache.class_eval do include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer add_method_tracer :get end Copy Tracing blocks of code Sometimes a single method is so complex that tracking overall time doesn't give enough detail. In these cases, you can wrap a block of code with a tracer. Call trace_execution_scoped passing the code to trace as a block: extend ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def slow_action self.class.trace_execution_scoped(['Custom/slow_action/beginning_work']) do # do stuff and report execution time with a custom metric name end # more stuff, whose time will be \"blamed\" to slow_action end Copy For more information, see add_method_tracer in the New Relic RubyDoc . Naming transactions Instrumented transactions are used to determine the throughput and overall response time for your application. The name of the method and the class will be used for the name of the transaction as reported to New Relic. For more information, see Viewing transaction traces. Normally the agent automatically chooses the transaction name. If you want to change the name of a transaction while it is still running, use NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name and the corresponding NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. This is useful if you want to segment your transaction based on some criteria. For example, if you wanted to vary the transaction name by response format in Rails: class UsersController def index @users = User.all respond_to do |format| format.html format.json do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.json') render :json => @users end format.xml do NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name('Users/index.xml') render :xml => @users end end end end Copy Renaming transactions can also be used to segment your requests around some business criteria. For example, you could segment a transaction into \"Big Customer\" and \"Small Customer\" with code like this: class UsersController before_filter :segment_new_relic_by_customer_size def segment_new_relic_by_customer_size new_relic_name = NewRelic::Agent.get_transaction_name if current_user.big_customer? NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - big customer\") else NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name(\"#{new_relic_name} - small customer\") end end end Copy Tracing transaction entry points Ordinarily the agent will be able to identify transactions within your application, but if you're not using a supported framework, or if you'd like to record transactions that the agent is not automatically recording, you can define methods as being transaction entry points: class Controller include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy Instrumenting non-web transactions Along with method-level tracing, you can instrument non-web transactions, such as background tasks, with the same level of transaction and error detail as web transactions. For more information, see Monitoring Ruby background processes and daemons. Advanced custom instrumentation When tracing code not automatically instrumented by the agent, the standard method tracers will usually be enough. However, sometimes you need to instrument something more complex than a single method call. For example, you may want to instrument a few lines of code within a method, or you may want to start a transaction in one part of your code and finish it elsewhere. The Tracer module, introduced in agent version 6.0, provides a flexible API that lets you create transactions and segments as well as interact with the current transaction. Instrumenting a section of code To instrument a section of code, wrap the code in a block, then pass the block to the Tracer.in_transaction method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' def long_and_complex_process expensive_setup Tracer.in_transaction(partial_name: 'Complex/process', category: :task) do code_to_be_instrumented end expensive_teardown end Copy The agent will ensure that a transaction exists, and will create a segment within it for the code inside the block. Starting a transaction or segment If you need to start a transaction at one location in your code but finish it in another (as can happen with callback-based events), call Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment. You must call finish on the return value of this method: require 'new_relic/agent/tracer' class MyEventWatcher def event_started @transaction = Tracer.start_transaction_or_segment( partial_name: 'MyEventWatcher/my_event', category: :task) end def event_completed @transaction.finish end end Copy For more information, see trace_execution_scoped in the New Relic RubyDoc.

      "body": "Here is information about how to use the current service maps feature. For help using the earlier service maps feature, see Legacy APM service maps. Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

      "body": "With APM's Ruby agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view using solutions like APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime The custom runtime method includes an example of deploying a Sinatra app. If you need specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. Deploy using GAE's native support When using Google App Engine \"native mode\" installation, you provide your app code and an app.yaml file. Google App Engine then deploys to a standard prebuilt Docker image. To deploy with native support for Sinatra or Rails: Follow New Relic's standard procedures to install the gem, including your license key. Install the Ruby agent configuration file. Once the gem and configuration file have been installed, the Ruby agent can automatically monitor applications that reside in the GAE flexible environment. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime using Docker Tip If your Ruby app needs specific libraries or headers, New Relic recommends using the custom runtime method. In addition, New Relic recommends that you allow Google App Engine to handle health checks. See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. The example uses a Sinatra app for Ruby. For more information about deploying and configuring your Ruby app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Ruby Google App Engine's tutorials for Ruby 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Ruby agent, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Ruby to create a new Google Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom entrypoint: bundle exec ruby app.rb Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the recommended base image for apps monitored by the New Relic Ruby agent: FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/ruby:latest Copy 4. Build a Docker image Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t custom_ruby_app_container:latest . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named custom_ruby_app_container and tagged latest. 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Handle health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. New Relic recommends that you allow health checks for Ruby apps so that Google can check that your service is up and balanced properly. However, if excessive health checks cause congested transaction traces, you can set the Ruby agent to ignore the health check requests. To handle health checks, add a route for _ah/health in your app. To ignore health check requests, set the rules.ignore_url_regexes config setting in the application’s Ruby agent config to include '_ah/health'. Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Ruby agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

If you see large Application Code segments in transaction trace details, custom instrumentation can give a more complete picture of what is going on in your application. Tip Collecting too many metrics can impact the performance of your application and New Relic. To avoid data problems, keep the total number of unique metrics introduced by custom instrumentation under 2000. Method tracers The easiest way to capture custom instrumentation is by tracing calls to a particular method. Tracing a method as described below will insert an additional node in your transaction traces for each invocation of that method, providing greater detail about where time is going in your transactions.

      "body": "Here is information about how to use the current service maps feature. For help using the earlier service maps feature, see Legacy APM service maps. Service maps helps you visualize dependencies quickly and easily across your environment. They help you see how all your entities work together across your system. You can use service maps to troubleshoot problems, see how your environment works together, and ensure that issues don’t have downstream repercussions. Service maps also supports cross-account access so help you see relationships between entities for all your accounts. Requirements Service maps work with distributed tracing to connect relationships between entities. Service maps are still functional if you have not enabled distributed tracing, but we recommend having distributed tracing enabled for all agents. This ensures a more consistent experience while using service maps. For best results, update existing agents to the latest version. The required minimum agent versions for maps are: Minimum versions when distributed tracing is enabled The required minimum agent versions for maps using distributed tracing are: C SDK 1.1.0 or higher Go agent 2.1.0 or higher Java agent 4.3.0 or higher .NET agent 8.6.45.0 or higher Node.js agent 4.7.0 or higher PHP agent 8.4 or higher Python agent 4.2.0.100 or higher Ruby agent 5.3.0.346 or higher Minimum versions when distributed tracing is NOT enabled The minimum version requirements for maps not using distributed tracing are: C SDK: not available Go 1.11 or higher Java 3.9.0 or higher .NET 4.2 or higher Node.js 2.0.0 or higher PHP 4.19.0 or higher Python 2.38.0.31 or higher Ruby 4.3.0 or higher Add or remove connections to an entity To view service maps, from one.newrelic.com click Explorer. Once you select an entity to view, you can select service maps from the sidebar. The map shows your upstream and downstream services: entities toward the left are upstream, entities toward the right are downstream. To add or remove connections to an entity: Hover over the entity in the map that you want to alter. Click add or remove more connections. In the connection list, keep boxes checked for the entities that you want to appear in the map. Unchecked entities will be removed from the map. Color coded for alerts Each entity in a map displays a color dependent on its performance. Green: there are currently no violations for this entities performance. Yellow: there is an open warning violation for this entity. Red: there is an open critical violation for this entity. Gray: no alert conditions have been set for the entity White: agent not reporting. This means that the agent installed on the entity is not reporting any data. This is expected behavior for databases or externals. Understand dependencies using API You can discover the same relationship connections available in service maps with NerdGraph. For more information and examples, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL relationships API tutorial. Externals and databases in maps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. Externals and databases have slightly different features in service maps than other entity types: Unlike other entities that appear in service maps, externals are aggregates. Clicking on an external service in the map shows you the list of all the external services that are rolled up into the one external entity. This is to reduce map clutter, as some entities can have dozens of externals being reported. Databases are agentless. Because of this, alerts cannot be set for the database, as only see the service call is reported to New Relic. Missing nodes If you are unable to view certain entities in New Relic One service maps, see Troubleshooting: Missing or obfuscated data in New Relic One.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "With the Errors UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page Important As of October 1, 2021, the APM Errors (classic) UI will be discontinued in favor of the New Relic One APM Errors UI. For more details, see our Explorers Hub post. To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

      "body": "With the Errors UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page Important As of October 1, 2021, the APM Errors (classic) UI will be discontinued in favor of the New Relic One APM Errors UI. For more details, see our Explorers Hub post. To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this... Change how the thread profile information appears Select your choices of available options in the Tree settings, and select Refresh tree. Change how much information appears Select the Expand or Collapse options above the call tree, or select the name or arrow on any line in the call tree. View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications).

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format.
