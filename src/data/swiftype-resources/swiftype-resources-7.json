      "body": "Alerts lets you create customized alerting solutions for monitoring your system. When you set up alerts, you can get notified about problems you're interested in. To help you get started, here are some alerts concepts and the workflow you'll follow. Introduction to important concepts To use alerts well, it will help you to understand the general flow of how the conditions and policies you create lead to violations and notifications. To use alerts well, it will help you to understand the terms we use: Alerts terminology Comments Policy A policy is a group of one or more alert conditions. You must create a policy before you can add conditions to it. A policy has two settings that apply to all of its conditions: incident preference and notification channels (explained more below). Condition A condition includes: a) a monitored data source and b) thresholds that define the behavior that's considered a violation. For example, a specific condition might be described in this way: \"If the response time for any page load in my app goes above 8 seconds and lasts for more than 5 minutes, that's a violation.\" Threshold A threshold is part of a condition; it defines the behavior that's considered a violation. When you create a condition, there's a required critical-level threshold. Optionally, you can set a secondary warning-level threshold. Violation A violation occurs when the value of a data source crosses a condition's threshold. This leads to the creation of a violation event, which is used to pass important information downstream. A violation doesn't directly generate a notification; a violation may lead to an incident, which in turn can generate notifications. Incident Incidents are what generate notifications. At the policy level, the incident preference determines how violations are handled and combined to generate incidents. For example, you may want to have every single violation generate an incident (many notifications) or you may want to have only a single incident open at a time across an entire alert policy (minimal notifications). Setting the incident preference gives you power over how notifications are created and helps prevent notification fatigue. Notification At the policy level, you choose what team members are notified when an incident occurs and how they're notified. We offer several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, etc. You can include charts about the incident to provide context, and share them with your team's notification. For in-depth definitions of these and other terms, see the glossary. Basic workflow Now that you understand some basic concepts and terms, let's look at a typical process for creating a policy and an associated condition: Create a policy. When you create a policy: Give it a meaningful name. For example: the group or team's name, or the set of resources or services the policy targets. Set the incident preference, which determines how violations become incidents. Set notification channels. Create a condition that will be attached to that policy. Steps involved in creating a condition include: Choose a data source that will be monitored (for example, an APM metric or a NRQL query). Set the thresholds that define what behavior will produce a violation. Optional: Include a runbook URL, which is used to share standard procedures for how to handle alert notifications. Optional: Add more conditions to that same policy. In addition to receiving notifications, you can view the alert incident or event details in New Relic One. What's next?

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

To turn a condition off but keep it with the policy, disable it. To delete one or more conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the list of Alert conditions, (select a condition), enable the condition if disabled, then click Delete.

To view a summary of current alert violations, mouse over its health status indicator. If no, its health status indicator on the selected index will appear grey. Important To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see Introduction to important concepts. Exceptions The health status indicator doesn't apply for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure entities Dashboards Entities targeted by labels Color-coded health status The index automatically appears when you select the product from the New Relic menu bar. For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "This document explains the different ways violations can be closed. How violations automatically close A violation will automatically close when the targeted signal returns to a non-violating state for the time period indicated in the condition's thresholds. This wait time is called the recovery period. For example: If the violating behavior is \"Apdex score below 0.80 at least once in 5 minutes,\" then the violation will automatically close when the Apdex score is equal to or higher than .80 for 5 consecutive minutes. The same applies to a \"for at least x minutes\" threshold: x minutes of non-violating behavior are required to automatically close the violation. When a violation closes automatically: The closing timestamp is backdated to the start of the recovery period. The evaluation resets and restarts from when the previous violation ended. All conditions have a violation time limit setting that will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation. Manually close a violation You can manually close an open violation. This is useful, for example, when a signal has violated the threshold, but it no longer exists and also doesn't have a violation time limit. (A time limit would automatically close a long-lasting violation.) To close a violation: Go to the open violation you want to close. Click Manually close violation. To close all violations associated with a condition: Go to the condition you want to close. Disable the condition and then re-enable it. Important An incident will close automatically when all of its associated critical violations have been closed. Set a time limit for long-lasting violations The violation time limit setting will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the number of days/hours you select. This is most useful for ephemeral entities that, when they disappear, cause a continual violation that won't automatically close. Limits and Defaults All alert violations will have a violation time limit applied to them. Most alert conditions will allow you to edit this field. The default value, if one is not supplied during configuration, is 3 days (24 hours for Infrastructure conditions). The violation time limit for non-Infrastructure conditions can be set as low as 5 minutes, and as high as 30 days. If, for some reason, the signal is still violating in 30 days, the violation will close, and a new violation will open. Infrastructure conditions can be set to the following hours: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, or 72. Examples: You set the violation time limit to 12 hours. If that violation lasts for 12 hours, it will be closed at 12 hours and the condition's evaluation of that entity will be reset. Your JVM has a CPU spike and this creates a violation. The JVM then crashes and is replaced by a new JVM. If you have not set a violation time limit, the crashed JVM’s violation will never close.",

To view a summary of current alert violations, mouse over its health status indicator. If no, its health status indicator on the selected index will appear grey. Important To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see Introduction to important concepts. Exceptions The health status indicator doesn't apply for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure entities Dashboards Entities targeted by labels Color-coded health status The index automatically appears when you select the product from the New Relic menu bar. For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations.

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Configuring incident detection consistently across your entire estate helps you track the overall health of your systems, avoid blindspots, and reduce the time it takes to identify and resolve issues. We know that creating accurate alert conditions is anything but simple. Knowing which metrics to monitor, and setting the thresholds accordingly, is a task that few have the necessary knowledge of both their systems and of New Relic to feel confident executing. This results in teams only applying incident detection practices to a subset of critical services. Good news: New Relic One now has an alert condition recommendation service that uses AI and machine learning (ML) to recommend specific metrics and signals to monitor for your specific entities. You can use the provided recommendations or modify them to fit your specific needs. Here’s how you can add recommended alerts to APM entities that do not currently have alert coverage. Using recommended conditions Go to Services - APM in New Relic Navigator and you’ll see a high-density view of the health of your system. With the traffic-light visual, it’s easy to view which entities are healthy, which entities have violations, and which entities do not have any alerts coverage. If an entity does not have alert coverage, its hexagon will be gray. Recommended conditions helps you automatically add alerts to entities that do not have alerts coverage, those gray hexagons. Select an entity: Click an uncovered entity (gray hexagon). A new option will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Click Create alert condition as shown in the image below. Choose a number of recommended conditions. The recommendations will depend on the quality of the tags associated with an entity. The more accurate and informative the tags are, the more precise the recommendations will be. The image below shows a few possible recommendations based on error percentage, Apdex, and response time.

Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for common ticketing systems. You can use any of these integrations to file tickets from APM. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Important This feature is a limited release. We’ve expanded anomaly detection coverage beyond your APM applications. Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save.

Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low. If it’s already set to Low, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. To define custom thresholds: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab and the configuration you want to modify. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level. You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.",

All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "Applied Intelligence (AI) is our AIOps solution for DevOps, site reliability engineers, and on-call teams. At its core, Applied Intelligence helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. By applying machine learning to your data and feedback, Applied Intelligence is designed to improve functionality and deliver smarter context over time. After connecting your data sources to Applied Intelligence, it looks for potential problems and improves based on your feedback. Why use Applied Intelligence? How you respond to an incident can mean thousands of dollars or clicks for your company. Applied Intelligence helps you solve problems faster. Feature Description Troubleshoot and respond to incidents Our solution helps you understand your incidents and gives you ideas for what to do next. Here are a few examples: Automatically classifies incidents based on the golden signals of site reliability engineering. Identifies entities in your stack that may relate to the underlying issue. Suggests responses for incidents based on historical context. Less noise, more focus As tools and systems become more complex, alert noise can overwhelm DevOps and SRE teams. Applied Intelligence correlates related incidents and suppresses noise, so you're only notified when human action is required. Incidents with a hybrid approach Applied Intelligence streamlines your incidents by combining its built-in inputs with your knowledge and feedback. Over time, the system delivers more accurate insights. For example: Our correlation and classification engine adjusts based on your feedback. The system automatically suggests new correlation rules based on your production data. You can create custom logic using the decision builder. Automatic anomaly detection Applied Intelligence provides automatic anomaly detection on all your APM-monitored applications. We detect anomalies in throughput, latency, and error rate, with no action required from you. Benefits include: No setup required. See anomalies surfaced automatically in the anomalies feed. See them in various New Relic activity streams (for example, on the New Relic One home page). Ability to run NRQL queries of anomalies and create custom dashboards with that data. Determine root causes with Incident Intelligence As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate incident events and reduce noise in your environment. With it, you can get an overview of all your issues, see suggested responders, and configure your own correlation logic. To get started, see Incident Intelligence. Find unknowns with Proactive Detection Another feature of Applied Intelligence is Proactive Detection. Proactive Detection is, by default, always on and detecting anomalies. These anomalies are surfaced in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, New Relic One activity streams, and can be queried, alerted on, and added to dashboards. Anomalies can be sent to Slack or via webhooks, and/or added as a source for Incident Intelligence correlation and issue notification. Proactive Detection also provides automatic analysis of anomalies and alerts via the analysis page. To get started, see Proactive Detection.",

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "The New Relic Insights query API is a REST API for making NRQL queries. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Requirements and recommendations This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Use of this API may be restricted by role-related user permissions. To add custom data to New Relic, you'd use our data ingest APIs. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. 1. Register an API key To use the Insights query API, you need a query key. You can have multiple query keys, and any query key can be used to initiate any Insights API query. If you have multiple systems querying Insights or different data destinations, New Relic recommends you use multiple query keys to enhance data security. For security reasons, query keys cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a query key, use the New Relic UI. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. To create a new query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Select the plus icon next to the Query keys heading. Enter a short description of the key. Select Save your notes. 2. Create the API query request When you create or edit a query key, you will see an example curl query that you can use as a template. The example query won't work unless you follow these query rules: The NRQL query string must be URL-encoded. The query string must be less than 4000 bytes. The URL must contain a valid account ID. The X-Query-Key must contain a valid query key. The Content-Type must be application/json. Linux Here is a curl example: curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY\" Copy Microsoft Windows You can use Powershell to query events via API: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY -Headers @{\"X-Query-Key\"=\"YOUR_QUERY_KEY\"} -ContentType \"application/json\" -Method GET Copy 3. Process the returned JSON The query API returns results in JSON format. There is a limit of 2,000 results per request. The structure of the JSON data depends on the NRQL that you used in the request: Different combinations of SELECT statements, clauses, and functions each return an appropriate response. When writing your code to process the JSON, you should do a test run of your query and examine the resulting JSON. Example The Insights query API returns JSON data. Here's an example of a query, its query request format, and its returned data: Query, query API request, returned data Original NRQL query: SELECT count(appName) FROM PageView SINCE '2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500' Copy Query cURL request (with URL-encoded NRQL query): curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=SELECT+count%28appName%29+FROM+PageView+SINCE+%272014-08-04+00%3A00%3A00%2B0500%27\" Copy Returned JSON data: { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 80275388 } ], \"metadata\": { \"eventTypes\": [ \"PageView\" ], \"eventType\": \"PageView\", \"openEnded\": true, \"beginTime\": \"2014-08-03T19:00:00Z\", \"endTime\": \"2017-01-18T23:18:41Z\", \"beginTimeMillis=\": 1407092400000, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"rawSince\": \"'2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500'\", \"rawUntil\": \"`now`\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"clippedTimeWindows\": { \"Browser\": { \"beginTimeMillis\": 1483571921198, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"retentionMillis\": 1209600000 } }, \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"count\", \"attribute\": \"appName\", \"simple\": true } ] } } Copy Rate limiting guidelines We have query rate limits. You likely won't encounter these limits, especially if you follow these general guidelines: Limit the amount of requests with complex queries (for example, queries with FACET or TIMESERIES clauses, or queries of over a million events) run at the same time. Limit the amount of requests run concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of 5, especially if they include complex queries. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for the number of queries per minute, the query API returns a 429 error. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for records inspected, the query API returns a 503 error and your charts may display timeout error messages.",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "Do not use the Insights Dashboards API. Instead, use the New Relic One Dashboards API with NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. End of life notice The Insights Dashboard API reaches end of life in 2021. As of July 28, 2021, the CREATE and UPDATE endpoints are not available. As of August 30, 2021, the GET and DELETE endpoints are not available. To make the transition from the Insights Dashboard API to the New Relic One Dashboards API, see our migration guide. For more information, see the NerdGraph dashboards tutorial and Explorers Hub post. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule.

You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID.

To learn general information about entities, their relationships, and how to use them, see Entities. Relationship types Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

To learn general information about entities, their relationships, and how to use them, see Entities. Relationship types Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

To learn general information about entities, their relationships, and how to use them, see Entities. Relationship types Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on.

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey: \"example-route-key\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type config { key routeKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Webhook notification channel An example create mutation for a Webhook notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { baseUrl: \"https://example.com/webhook\", basicAuth: { password: \"t0t4lly-s3cr3t-p455w0rd\", username: \"webhook-user\" }, customHttpHeaders: [ {name: \"X-Api-Key\", value: \"100%-real-api-key\"}, {name:

{ password username } baseUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an xMatters notification channel An example create mutation for an xMatters notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the policy because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated channels to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "body": "With NerdGraph, you can query details about your monitored entities. Important To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics API tutorial. Entity definition Entities are an important New Relic concept. Basically, an entity is anything we monitor, including but not limited to: Applications monitored by APM. Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our infrastructure monitoring. Learn more about how we define \"entity.\" To view entity details in the UI, you can use the Explorer. When working with entities in NerdGraph, it can help to understand some important traits they have: A unique entity GUID identifies an entity. An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period. An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities. Requirements You need a user key. Search for entities New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID. You can craft a query in one of two ways: Use the queryBuilder argument to help you craft a query. OR Use the freeform query argument to provide your own search. To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to these examples, we highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and searching its inline documentation. Search by attribute Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example: query($query: String! ) { actor { entitySearch(query: $query) { count results { entities { name entityType guid } } } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section in NerdGraph: {\"query\": \"name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND type IN ('APPLICATION')\"} Copy Search by entity GUID Use a specific entity's GUID to query deeper into its related data. For example: query($guids: EntityGuid! ) { actor { entities(guids: $guids) { entityType name } } } Copy Add the following variables to the Query variables section: {\"guids\": \"entity-guid-here\"} Copy Example queries Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Entities in NerdGraph rely on GraphQL interfaces, a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples. Get entity data using the queryBuilder If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, you can rely on NerdGraph to help you build one, and then retrieve entity data and the query string that was built. Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the queryBuilder argument. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch( queryBuilder : {type: APPLICATION}) { query results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the infrastructureIntegrationType input argument to explore them. You cannot use the query and queryBuilder arguments at the same time. Use infrastructureIntegrationType in place of the type input argument. We highly recommend exploring the API using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you. { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: { infrastructureIntegrationType : F5_NODE}) { query results { entities { entityType domain } } } } } Copy Get alert information on alertable entities in search results Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic's Alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the reporting field). If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity. If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the AlertableEntityOutline fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { reporting ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } Copy Get summary data on APM entities in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities: More summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate apdexScore webResponseTimeAverage responseTimeAverage } } } } } } } Copy Get data specific to each entity type in search results Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline { apmSummary { errorRate } } ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline { browserSummary { jsErrorRate } } ... on MobileApplicationEntityOutline { mobileSummary { httpErrorRate } } } } } } } Copy Get all tags for each entity in search results This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerdgraph'\") { results { entities { name tags { key values } } } } } } Copy Get the nextCursor for paginated search results The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request nextCursor in your initial request and use its value in another query to retrieve the following \"page\" of results. If there are no more results, nextCursor will be null. { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Use the value of nextCursor in your next search: { actor { entitySearch(query: \"name like 'nerd-graph'\") { results(cursor: \"next_cursor_value\") { nextCursor entities { name } } } } } Copy Delete entities You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: mutation { entityDelete(guids: [\"EntityGuid\"]) { deletedEntities failures } } Copy Note that a deleted entity may appear again in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.",

Browser (End user tier) SLA metric name:value (and formula) Page Views thousands EndUser : call_count Load time sec EndUser : average_response_time Apdex EndUser/Apdex : score % Satisfied EndUser/Apdex : s divided by EndUser : call_count % Tolerating EndUser/Apdex : t divided by Enduser : call_count % Frustrated EndUser/Apdex : f divided by Enduser : call_count App server metrics for SLAs Here are the SLA metrics for application servers. App server SLA metric name:value (and formula) Requests millions HttpDispatcher : call_count (scaled appropriately) Resp. time ms HttpDispatcher : average_response_time (multiplied by 1000) Apdex Apdex : score % Satisfied Apdex : s divided by Apdex : count % Tolerating Apdex : t divided by Apdex : count % Frustrated Apdex : f divided by Apdex : count Tips for collecting metrics Here are some tips for planning which metrics to collect. SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which the agent gathered browser data. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browser types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone. Adjust the from= and to= for your time range as desired. There are syntactical differences between New Relic's REST API v2 and v1. The examples show how to use each.

      "body": "The word transaction can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported. What is a transaction? At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. When you install APM in a supported system, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up custom instrumentation to report additional transactions. Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use custom instrumentation. Types of transactions Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the Transactions page. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web: Web: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. Non-web: Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks. Transaction sub-types Our agents have these transaction sub-types: C SDK Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. Go Doesn't apply. Java Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. framework The invocation of a framework that is recognized by the agent. .NET Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. ASP The invocation of an ASP.NET request. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. MonoRail The invocation of a MonoRail request. MVC The invocation of a MVC request. OpenRasta The invocation of an OpenRasta request. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. WCF The invocation of a WCF request. WebAPI The invocation of a WebAPI request. WebService The invocation of a WebService request. Node.JS Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Message Message broker or queue communication. PHP Sub-type Description Action The invocation of the named framework action. Used when the agent is able to identify a framework-specific action name. Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Function The invocation of the named function. PHP The invocation of a background PHP job. StatusCode The HTTP status code returned for the transaction. Often used when a more specific transaction sub-type is unavailable. unknown The invocation of an unknown web transaction or background job. URI The invocation of the named URI. Usually used when a framework or language level transaction name cannot be determined. Python Sub-type Description ASGIWeb WebTransaction from an ASGI application. Message Message broker or queue communication. WSGIWeb WebTransaction from a WSGI application. Ruby Sub-type Description Custom The execution of the named custom transaction. Usually recorded via manual instrumentation APIs. Transaction segments The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called segments. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM. The APM Transactions page displays aggregate transaction segment data. To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To see the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. Transaction naming For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL. For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as /user/*/control_panel, where the * represents different user names. To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use custom instrumentation. Monitoring transactions Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions: If you want to monitor... Use this... Transactions important to your business Create key transactions, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them. Async activity Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific APM language agent. Activity across applications Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about distributed tracing and cross application traces. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Query transactions Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of default attributes attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default. For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see Query New Relic data.",

      "body": "This approach adds a new authentication method to the customer-facing New Relic REST API (v2) that allows partners (and enterprise-scale customers that use the partnership structure to manage their multiple accounts) to use their partnership credentials to authorize all REST API (v2) calls. It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . .

After you select your choice of functions for the type of API call (applications, browsers, etc.), the user interface provides an interactive form to view requirements and test your parameter values. It also provides a live source of documentation about the API values. API key requirements Before you can use the API Explorer, API access must be activated and an API key must be generated for your account. Important We recommend using the user key, not the REST API key, because the user key has fewer restrictions. Tips: If you're signed in to New Relic, when you use the API Explorer you can choose your API key at the top of the UI and that key will appear automatically in the Request and Parameters sections of the Explorer. If you're not signed in to New Relic, you can paste your API key into the API Explorer's Parameters. Access the API Explorer To use the New Relic API Explorer: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's menu bar, select the account name for your app from the dropdown list. From the sidebar, select a feature (applications, browsers, etc.) and an available API function: GET, PUT, DELETE. Type the other Parameters values for your API call.

This example shows the time range for a specific 24 hour period. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=requests_per_minute&from=2014-02-21T23:59:00+00:00&to=2014-02-22T23:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Be sure to replace $ { APPID} and $ { APIKEY} with your application ID and API key for the account. To change the time range, include from and to values. To keep the default time period of the last 30 minutes, omit the from and to values. To return a series of throughput values instead of an average, omit summarize. Here is an example of the Throughput chart on the APM Summary page. You can use the New Relic REST API (v2) to return the average Throughput value that appears here. Web app throughput (single host) To find the average throughput from a single host, for a given time period, use a single command to get the metric HttpDispatcher:requests_per_minute, and specify the numeric $ { HOST}.

Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

      "body": "The application name you see in the New Relic's user interface is a human-readable alias for the primary name assigned in your configuration settings. If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI. You must also provide APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, and the monitoring enabled BOOLEAN (true or false) even if they are not being modified. curl -X PUT \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"application\": { \"name\": \"name\", \"settings\": { \"app_apdex_threshold\": APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"end_user_apdex_threshold\": BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"enable_real_user_monitoring\": BOOLEAN } } }' Copy This is the equivalent of using the APM UI to change the displayed app name.

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI.

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version. To find the version ID of your mobile application, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) from Mobile where appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' facet appVersionId since 1 day ago export const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"Mobile crash count and crash rate example (v2)\",\"tags\":[\"APIs\",\"REST API v2\",\"Mobile examples (v2)\"],\"metaDescription\":\"How to use New Relic's REST API (v2) to get crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile app or a specific version.\",\"redirects\":[\"/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/mobile-crash-count-crash-rate-example-v2\"]} Copy",

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

      "body": "This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to get your mobile application's overall and version-specific crash count and crash rate, which appear on the Summary page in the upper right corner. These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version. To find the version ID of your mobile application, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) from Mobile where appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' facet appVersionId since 1 day ago export const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"Mobile crash count and crash rate example (v2)\",\"tags\":[\"APIs\",\"REST API v2\",\"Mobile examples (v2)\"],\"metaDescription\":\"How to use New Relic's REST API (v2) to get crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile app or a specific version.\",\"redirects\":[\"/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/mobile-crash-count-crash-rate-example-v2\"]} Copy",

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

      "body": "The New Relic REST API (v2) paginates some responses, for performance reasons. This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

      "body": "The New Relic REST API (v2) paginates some responses, for performance reasons. This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one. Parameter Description ...page=2>;rel=\"next\" Page 2 is the next page ...page=3>;rel=\"last\" Page 3 is the last page",

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. Use the following command to obtain this. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_network_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Page rendering time Page rendering time is a derived value. To calculate it, use this equation: \"Page rendering\" time = EndUser:average_fe_response_time - EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:average_fe_response_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_fe_response_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds.

DOM processing time The EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time is the time spent in the browser to parse and interpret the HTML. This is measured by the browser's DOM Content event. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds.

This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Important When you add a browser app via API (v2), you can only instrument basic page load timing. To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, set up single page app monitoring via another method. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser applications > POST create.

It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your browser-monitored apps, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command.

      "body": "Here are examples of how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to add apps to browser monitoring or to get a list of your browser apps for a specific API key. This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Important When you add a browser app via API (v2), you can only instrument basic page load timing. To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, set up single page app monitoring via another method. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser applications > POST create. Use the following command: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"browser_application\": { \"name\": ${STRING} } }' Copy The API returns an array of data where the element is a browser application and the data associated with it: { \"browser_application\": { \"id\": \"integer\", \"name\": \"string\", \"browser_monitoring_key\": \"string\", \"loader_script\": \"string\" } Copy API (v2) output Description Browser app id (integer) This is the unique identification code for each app in New Relic One. App name (string) This is the app's name as it appears in the New Relic One. The browser_monitoring_key (string) This a unique key that is linked to (but is not the same as) the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your browser-monitored apps, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List. Use the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy You can use the results to verify the account or name, and to get a copy of the loader script for the app, if needed. View specific browser apps View by name: To view a specific browser app if you know its name, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${NAME} with your app's name in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"filter[name]=${NAME}\" Copy View by browser application ID: To view a specific browser app if you know its ID, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${ID} with your browser application ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=${ID}' Copy View multiple browser apps: To get information for multiple apps, separate the name or ID values with a comma in these commands; for example: -d 'filter[ids]=12345,23456' Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . . Copy List instance IDs The instance ID meaning depends on the New Relic language agent being used. You can list this ID from the REST API. For Java, you can also view the instance ID (JVM) from APM's Overview page. Agent Instance ID represents Go The Go program on the host reporting to the app name Java A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) .NET For New Relic's .NET Framework agent, this is the AppDomain Node.js A worker process PHP The daemon agent Ruby An individual Ruby worker process Python The master and worker processes You can retrieve summary metrics for the instance as well as specific metric timeslice values using the {INSTANCE_ID}. For details about available metrics, use the REST API Explorer Application Instance page. Instance ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $INSTANCE_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the $INSTANCE_ID for each instance. {INSTANCE_ID} output The { INSTANCE_ID} output will appear similar to this: { \"application_instances\": [ { \"id\": 35120, <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1441, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_host\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} } }, { \"id\": 186288, <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1441, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_host\": 186283, <---<<< {HOST_ID} } }, . . . Copy Java instance ID (JVM) using the UI Java apps: To locate a specific JVM $INSTANCE_ID in New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > Applications > (select an app) > JVMs. Select the name of the instance. In the URL, the number after the _i designator represents the Java JVM instance: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/applications/$APP_ID_i$INSTANCE_ID Copy REST API application list example The following example shows how to locate all the ID information for an application by using the APP_ID. If you have an EU account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=1441' <----<<<< {APP_ID} Copy The resulting example output is running on five servers. One server is hosting two virtual hosts for a total of six hosts.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . . Copy List instance IDs The instance ID meaning depends on the New Relic language agent being used. You can list this ID from the REST API. For Java, you can also view the instance ID (JVM) from APM's Overview page. Agent Instance ID represents Go The Go program on the host reporting to the app name Java A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) .NET For New Relic's .NET Framework agent, this is the AppDomain Node.js A worker process PHP The daemon agent Ruby An individual Ruby worker process Python The master and worker processes You can retrieve summary metrics for the instance as well as specific metric timeslice values using the {INSTANCE_ID}. For details about available metrics, use the REST API Explorer Application Instance page. Instance ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $INSTANCE_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown.

Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the $INSTANCE_ID for each instance. {INSTANCE_ID} output The { INSTANCE_ID} output will appear similar to this: { \"application_instances\": [ { \"id\": 35120, <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1441, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_host\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} } }, { \"id\": 186288, <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1441, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_host\": 186283, <---<<< {HOST_ID} } }, . . . Copy Java instance ID (JVM) using the UI Java apps: To locate a specific JVM $INSTANCE_ID in New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > Applications > (select an app) > JVMs. Select the name of the instance. In the URL, the number after the _i designator represents the Java JVM instance: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/applications/$APP_ID_i$INSTANCE_ID Copy REST API application list example The following example shows how to locate all the ID information for an application by using the APP_ID. If you have an EU account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=1441' <----<<<< {APP_ID} Copy The resulting example output is running on five servers.

      "body": "This approach adds a new authentication method to the customer-facing New Relic REST API (v2) that allows partners (and enterprise-scale customers that use the partnership structure to manage their multiple accounts) to use their partnership credentials to authorize all REST API (v2) calls. It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2). It does not work with the following: Deployment API Infrastructure API for alerts Insights API Insights Dashboard API Partner API Plugin API Synthetics API",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's REST API to obtain a list of metric timeslice data about your plugin's components (instances), including metric names and values, for the account associated with your API key. Tip When using these examples, be sure to replace each placeholder (for example, ${COMPONENT_ID}) with its specific ID. Listing a component's metric names To obtain a list of the metric names for a single component by its ${COMPONENT_ID}, use this API call: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/components/${COMPONENT_ID}/metrics.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy The output (JSON format) lists the metric name and values: { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"Agent/MetricsReported/count\", <---<<< METRIC_NAME \"values\": [ \"average_response_time\", <---<<< METRIC_VALUES listing \"calls_per_minute\", \"call_count\", \"min_response_time\", \"max_response_time\", \"average_exclusive_time\", \"average_value\", \"requests_per_minute\", \"standard_deviation\" ] }, { \"name\": \"Component/Client SSL Profiles/Current Cache Entries//Common/clientssl-insecure-compatible[entries]\", \"values\": [ \"average_value\", \"total_value\", \"max_value\", \"min_value\", \"standard_deviation\", \"rate\", \"count\" ] }, ... } } Copy Listing a specific metric name and values To obtain a single metric name and the available metric values for a specific plugin component, replace the $ { COMPONENT_ID} and $ { METRIC_NAME} placeholders with the actual values in the following API call: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/components/${COMPONENT_ID}/metrics.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"name=${METRIC_NAME}\" Copy The output will be similar to what appears when you create an API call for multiple metric names. Specifying the metric data values To obtain the metric timeslice data for a specific component, use any of the following API calls. Be sure to replace the $ { COMPONENT_ID}, $ { APIKEY}, $ { METRIC_NAME} and $ { METRIC_VALUE} placeholders with the actual values. If you want to... Use this API call...

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2). It does not work with the following: Deployment API Infrastructure API for alerts Insights API Insights Dashboard API Partner API Plugin API Synthetics API",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2).

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same.

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order. Synthetics API attribute Definition apiVersion String: The version number. emails Array of strings: Email addresses for alert notifications with New Relic. frequency Integer: Number of minutes between checks. Valid values include 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, and 1440. id The UUID for the specific Synthetics monitor. locations Array of strings: Array of locations by full label. name String: The monitor's name. scriptLocations String: The name and hmac values for private locations using Verified Script Execution. scriptText String: The BASE64 encoded text for scripted monitors. slaThreshold Double: Value for the Synthetics SLA report, in seconds. status String: Valid values include ENABLED, MUTED, and DISABLED. type String: Type of monitor. Valid values include: SIMPLE (Ping) BROWSER SCRIPT_BROWSER SCRIPT_API uri String: The URI for SIMPLE and BROWSER monitor types; for example, http://my-site.com.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "With the Errors UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page Important As of October 1, 2021, the APM Errors (classic) UI will be discontinued in favor of the New Relic One APM Errors UI. For more details, see our Explorers Hub post. To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions.

      "body": "With the Errors UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page Important As of October 1, 2021, the APM Errors (classic) UI will be discontinued in favor of the New Relic One APM Errors UI. For more details, see our Explorers Hub post. To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit.

To add more detail, or build a dashboard, click the View NRQL button on the chart to see the NRQL powering this view. The graph displays each unique limit type that was reached during the selected time-period. This can help you find any trends based on time. The Limits page also provides a table where you can find the limit name, the limit event message associated with it, and last occurrence time and date. If you click a limit in the table, you see more about what happened, and when. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a limit events table on the Limits UI page.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

      "body": "Application remediation involves gathering metrics and performance statistics about your application. This helps you identify bottlenecks and errors that can lead to instability in your software (and frustration for your users). New Relic provides views of your application’s performance to help you quickly identify and remediate errors. These quick wins ensure you and your colleagues can accelerate the momentum of DevOps in your organization. 1. Use semantic naming throughout New Relic Use semantic naming to give meaningful, structured names and labels to the applications you’re monitoring. Create a scalable syntax that can be understood, filtered, and sorted by any team who might use New Relic now or in the future. When you create your naming structure, be sure to consider growth and the potential for scaling/changes in your application’s architecture. Consider the following naming structure: store--us-web-prod store--us-web-stage store--us-web-dev This structure allows for additions to scale (for example, store-eu-web-prod-02), and makes the application’s environment searchable. Any convention you use should be unique to your organization’s structure, but be sure to use a convention that will allow you to optimize your environment as need. 2. Deploy the New Relic agent Review the compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products, and then follow the documentation to install the appropriate agent in your application. Once the agent is installed, you should see data begin to populate in New Relic within minutes. Tip If after several minutes, New Relic is not showing performance information, see No data appears. 3. Identify application performance outliers and errors The default charts in New Relic tell a story about your application’s performance. If there are performance issues, patterns in the charts highlight the causes. The following figure, from the Overview page in APM, shows a large spike occurred at noon on March 27th, and was nearly double the response time of our application’s overall trend: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Additionally, the response time breakdown shows a spike in Web external (which indicates downstream dependencies). Since the spike seems to correlate with periods of higher throughput, we can then use the Throughput chart to analyze the problem in more detail. 4. Drill into specific time frames Click and drag on a graph, to drill into a focused time slice of performance data to better isolate any issue you’re investigating. In this example, we’ve narrowed the view on the spike we saw in web transactions times: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Here, it’s obvious that some part of Web external, which is an application or service called by our Web portal app, is likely the source of the issue. 5. Drill into transaction traces to investigate outliers New Relic displays transactions ordered with the most time consuming transaction at the top. Click a transaction to navigate to the Transactions page and expand that transaction into its component parts and see any transaction traces that have been captured as a result of any performance issues. New Relic automatically captures these traces whenever a transaction violates your Apdex score by more than four times for a specific number of seconds. Tip If you’re not capturing any transaction traces, you may not be violating these thresholds. Be sure to configure transaction traces for your applications as needed. In the following example, we see that interceptor.ServletConfigInter... has significant transaction times: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview In fact, it’s responsible for 99.9% of the app server time, which means we’re getting closer to identifying the culprit of our spike. Here, we see the same spike from before, but the performance of the transaction is broken down into its components: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview While the share of the response times for most components of this transaction remained stable, GetPlansController (in brown) spiked massively. From the Transaction traces table, we can drill further into the transaction trace to get method-level detail of where the issue is occurring. 6. Identify performance outliers in the database We identified that GetPlansController is consuming the vast majority of our response time. Here we see it in the transaction trace summary: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview Trace details shows an execution timeline of this transaction, and we see that Plan Service is the external transaction causing the issues—the red color-coding indicates the problem. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview From this point, we can navigate to the Transactions summary page for Plan Service: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions The breakdown of the GetPlans transaction shows that database calls, particularly MySQL PlansTable select, appear to be a significant portion of the overall response time. The Breakdown table further identifies the problem: the number of database calls per transaction is very high. Note again that it’s highlighted in red. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions Once again, we can look at a transaction trace to find what might be causing these queries. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions Finally we find that an extremely large number of select methods account for the majority of transaction time. We can now take steps to address this potential N+1 query problem. After we remediate this issue, improved response times will lead to fewer frustrated requests and more satisfied customers—which will be reflected in this application's Apdex score. 7. Explore and Resolve Clusters of Errors When you need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. Using applied intelligence developed by New Relic, APM Error Profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. New Relic displays pie charts that sorts error attributes by the greatest deviation from the “norm.\" For backend errors, go to APM, select Error Analytics in the left nav, and then click on the Error Profile tab. In this example, the culprit is obviously a web transaction validating coupons, and now you can view the error stack trace, message, and the line of code from which the error was thrown. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Error Analytics > Error Profile As a quality customer experience increasingly relies on complex client-side logic, it’s important to quickly analyze and understand JavaScript errors. From one.newrelic.com, click Browser in the top header, and then click JS errors in left navigation menu. Expand the details about JavaScript errors by clicking on a attribute. In this case, we've expanded the transaction names that are related to the errors: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors Roughly half of the errors come from phone.jsp, so that is the place to start investigating. Then determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should resolve the error with code edits and a new deployment, or provide communication about the issue to your customers. Now that you have dealt with performance outliers and clusters of errors, you are well on your way to optimizing your application so you can baseline it for trend analysis.

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. ![This is an image of the thread profiler.] (./images/thread-profiler-session.png \"Thread profiler overview) one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this...

View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. ![This is an image of the thread profiler.] (./images/thread-profiler-session.png \"Thread profiler overview) one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this...

View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page.
