      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert.

Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification.

It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert.

Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert.

The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric].

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation.

For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

For more about the definition of violations and other terms, see Alerts concepts. What is a violation event? The violation of a condition generates a violation event. This event has various attributes (metadata) attached to it and different attributes can be used by different features. Important The violation event is a concept used to determine alerting features. While you can query some of its associated attributes via NerdGraph, you cannot directly query the violation event. Violation event attributes This table shows violation event attributes. The violation event data type is collected in NrAiIncident. BETA FEATURE NrAiIncident is still in development, so may be subject to unannounced changes, but we encourage you to try it out! You may be wondering why we're using NrAiIncident as the name for the violation event data type. Although we currently refer to these events as \"violations,\" they'll be called \"incidents\" in our new, upcoming naming scheme. This name prepares for and reflects our future intentions.

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert.

Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time.

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified.

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "Improve your Alerts coverage by implementing the following recommendations and get the most out of your alerts configuration. Read on to learn the best practices for: Policies Notification channels Incident preferences Thresholds and violations Muting rules Recommended alerts Use recommended alerts conditions conditions if you are new to Alerts or if you want suggestions that optimize your alert coverage. Organize your policies A policy is a container for similar conditions. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to create, edit, or find policies. Organize your policy's scope to a single entity when possible. Assign your policy to the essential team or teams that need to be notified when an incident occurs. This way, you keep policies centralized and focused. If a team is monitoring several groups of the same entity type, combine those entity clusters (like servers) together into one policy. This way, your team can be notified from one policy rather than navigating several policies at once. You can use Alerts to monitor all of your entities. Consider your role and priorities when assigning yourself to a policy. For example: Software developers may need notifications for both front-end and back-end performance, such as webpage response time and page load JavaScript errors. Operations personnel may need notifications for poor back-end performance, such as server memory and load averages. The product owner may need notifications for positive front-end performance, such as improved end user Apdex scores or sales being monitored in dashboards. Set your condition thresholds and violations Set meaningful threshold levels to optimize Alerts for your business. Here are some suggested guidelines: Action Recommendations Set threshold levels Avoid setting thresholds too low. For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives. Experimenting with settings You do not need to edit files or restart software, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary. Adjust settings Adjust your conditions over time. As you use our products to help you optimize your entity's performance, tighten your thresholds to keep pace with your improved performance. If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this. Disable settings You can disable any condition in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds. In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded health status indicator in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There are two violation thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the suggestions above. Important Warning violations do not open incidents. A critical violation can open incidents, but you must define that decision through your incident preferences. Decide what happens when there's no signal Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. You can configure loss of signal settings by condition in the UI or configure loss of signal via the NerdGraph API. Use non-null values when there's no signal By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or configure gap filling values via NerdGraph Define your incident preferences Decide when you get incident notifications so you can respond to incidents when they happen. If you’re new to Alerts, learn more about your incident preferences options. The default incident preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one incident. Change your default incident preference setting to increase or decrease the number of incidents and incident notifications you receive. Each team within your organization will have different needs. Ask your team two important questions when deciding your incident preferences: Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong? Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once? When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope (like managing the performance of several entities), increase the amount of incidents you receive. You will need more notifications because two incidents will not necessarily relate to each other. When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like managing the performance of one entity), opt for the default incident preference. You will need less notifications when two incidents are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem. Decide how you get incident notifications by using our notification channel best practices. Select your notification channels Tailor notifications to the most useful channel and policy so you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to set up notification channels. Notify teams and individuals who needs to stay updated on or resolve a problem when an incident arises. To stay updated, select a notification channel that is less intrusive, like email. For vital notifications and incident responses, select a notification channel that is more intrusive, like PagerDuty or Slack. Do not rely on email for quick notifications in case of delays. Understand muting rules Mute alerts during routine events, such as maintenance or planned downtime. You can also silence a policy, a specific entity, and a condition when needed. Incidents can still be opened, but you won't be notified. If you're new to Alerts, learn how to create and manage muting rules. What's next? To learn more about using alerts: Learn about the API. Read technical details about min/max limits and rules. Read more about about when you might want to use loss-of-signal and gap-filling settings.",

      "body": "Configuring incident detection consistently across your entire estate helps you track the overall health of your systems, avoid blindspots, and reduce the time it takes to identify and resolve issues. We know that creating accurate alert conditions is anything but simple. Knowing which metrics to monitor, and setting the thresholds accordingly, is a task that few have the necessary knowledge of both their systems and of New Relic to feel confident executing. This results in teams only applying incident detection practices to a subset of critical services. Good news: New Relic One now has an alert condition recommendation service that uses AI and machine learning (ML) to recommend specific metrics and signals to monitor for your specific entities. You can use the provided recommendations or modify them to fit your specific needs. Here’s how you can add recommended alerts to APM entities that do not currently have alert coverage. Using recommended conditions Go to Services - APM in New Relic Navigator and you’ll see a high-density view of the health of your system. With the traffic-light visual, it’s easy to view which entities are healthy, which entities have violations, and which entities do not have any alerts coverage. If an entity does not have alert coverage, its hexagon will be gray. Recommended conditions helps you automatically add alerts to entities that do not have alerts coverage, those gray hexagons. Select an entity: Click an uncovered entity (gray hexagon). A new option will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Click Create alert condition as shown in the image below. Choose a number of recommended conditions. The recommendations will depend on the quality of the tags associated with an entity. The more accurate and informative the tags are, the more precise the recommendations will be. The image below shows a few possible recommendations based on error percentage, Apdex, and response time.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 15 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If it takes your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration added to the delay/timer. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window.

Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered.

We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 15 seconds and 15 minutes, in 15-second increments. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with None, the last value received, or a static value. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_timer. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "The New Relic Insights query API is a REST API for making NRQL queries. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Requirements and recommendations This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Use of this API may be restricted by role-related user permissions. To add custom data to New Relic, you'd use our data ingest APIs. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. 1. Register an API key To use the Insights query API, you need a query key. You can have multiple query keys, and any query key can be used to initiate any Insights API query. If you have multiple systems querying Insights or different data destinations, New Relic recommends you use multiple query keys to enhance data security. For security reasons, query keys cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a query key, use the New Relic UI. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. To create a new query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Select the plus icon next to the Query keys heading. Enter a short description of the key. Select Save your notes. 2. Create the API query request When you create or edit a query key, you will see an example curl query that you can use as a template. The example query won't work unless you follow these query rules: The NRQL query string must be URL-encoded. The query string must be less than 4000 bytes. The URL must contain a valid account ID. The X-Query-Key must contain a valid query key. The Content-Type must be application/json. Linux Here is a curl example: curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY\" Copy Microsoft Windows You can use Powershell to query events via API: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY -Headers @{\"X-Query-Key\"=\"YOUR_QUERY_KEY\"} -ContentType \"application/json\" -Method GET Copy 3. Process the returned JSON The query API returns results in JSON format. There is a limit of 2,000 results per request. The structure of the JSON data depends on the NRQL that you used in the request: Different combinations of SELECT statements, clauses, and functions each return an appropriate response. When writing your code to process the JSON, you should do a test run of your query and examine the resulting JSON. Example The Insights query API returns JSON data. Here's an example of a query, its query request format, and its returned data: Query, query API request, returned data Original NRQL query: SELECT count(appName) FROM PageView SINCE '2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500' Copy Query cURL request (with URL-encoded NRQL query): curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=SELECT+count%28appName%29+FROM+PageView+SINCE+%272014-08-04+00%3A00%3A00%2B0500%27\" Copy Returned JSON data: { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 80275388 } ], \"metadata\": { \"eventTypes\": [ \"PageView\" ], \"eventType\": \"PageView\", \"openEnded\": true, \"beginTime\": \"2014-08-03T19:00:00Z\", \"endTime\": \"2017-01-18T23:18:41Z\", \"beginTimeMillis=\": 1407092400000, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"rawSince\": \"'2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500'\", \"rawUntil\": \"`now`\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"clippedTimeWindows\": { \"Browser\": { \"beginTimeMillis\": 1483571921198, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"retentionMillis\": 1209600000 } }, \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"count\", \"attribute\": \"appName\", \"simple\": true } ] } } Copy Rate limiting guidelines We have query rate limits. You likely won't encounter these limits, especially if you follow these general guidelines: Limit the amount of requests with complex queries (for example, queries with FACET or TIMESERIES clauses, or queries of over a million events) run at the same time. Limit the amount of requests run concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of 5, especially if they include complex queries. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for the number of queries per minute, the query API returns a 429 error. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for records inspected, the query API returns a 503 error and your charts may display timeout error messages.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits.

      "body": "Do not use the Insights Dashboards API. Instead, use the New Relic One Dashboards API with NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. End of life notice The Insights Dashboard API reaches end of life in 2021. As of July 28, 2021, the CREATE and UPDATE endpoints are not available. As of August 30, 2021, the GET and DELETE endpoints are not available. To make the transition from the Insights Dashboard API to the New Relic One Dashboards API, see our migration guide. For more information, see the NerdGraph dashboards tutorial and Explorers Hub post. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "A glossary of common terminology you may encounter. account dropdown In the upper right of the New Relic UI, the account dropdown gives you access to your account settings. If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "A glossary of common terminology you may encounter. account dropdown In the upper right of the New Relic UI, the account dropdown gives you access to your account settings. If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "Our log management capabilities help you to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. To get your logs into New Relic, you can: Use your existing log forwarding solution to collect your logs and extend the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Use our infrastructure agent as a lightweight data collector, without having to use additional software. Use our Log API to forward your logs via HTTP. Use syslog protocols to forward your logs via a TCP endpoint. How it works The following diagram shows the lifecycle of a log message for an app, from enrichment with APM agent metadata (contextual logging), to formatting and forwarding the log data to New Relic. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through New Relic. Standard log formatters transform log events into meaningful output (such as text files) that can be used by downstream people and processes. The NewRelicFormatter transforms log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. These files contain log information and extended metadata. When you configure your log forwarder (our infrastructure monitoring agent, Fluentd, Logstash, etc.), you can also extend and enrich your log data. By configuring logs in context, the log enricher links the formatted log data with additional transaction information from your application or host. Now your log files are enriched with enhanced metadata and contextual logging data. Your log forwarder sends the files to our logging endpoint for processing. From there you can use our log management capabilities to view, query, set up alerts, and more in New Relic. Get started with log forwarders To forward your logs to New Relic with enriched metadata: If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Have your New Relic account's license key. Install a compatible log forwarder. Ensure that outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. Use the DNS name log-api.newrelic.com or log-api.eu.newrelic.com for configuration. For apps monitored by a New Relic APM agent, configure logs in context. Log forwarding options Use any of these solutions to forward your logs to New Relic. Recommended: Infrastructure monitoring agent Amazon: AWS CloudWatch plugin AWS FireLens plugin AWS Kinesis Firehose AWS Lambda for sending logs from S3 Microsoft: Azure ARM template Other log forwarding plugins: Fluent Bit plugin Fluentd plugin Heroku log streaming Kubernetes plugin Logstash plugin Vector plugin TCP endpoint In some situations you may not have log forwarders; for example, with CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services. You can use syslog protocols such as rsyslog and syslog-ng, and forward your logs to New Relic via a TCP endpoint. Log API If you prefer to connect to New Relic without installing a plugin, we offer an HTTP input integration. This option sends your monitored log data directly to New Relic via the Log API. What's next? After you enable your log forwarder, make the most of your data in New Relic with our log management capabilities: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data if you are forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards. For example, to query and manage your data partition rules, see our NerdGraph tutorial.",

      "body": "New public APIs Public APIs are now available for parsing and pipeline configuration (such as drop filters). Documentation can be found within the NerdGraph API explorer. Additional external documentation is coming soon! Headerless HTTP ingest Added support for Headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key).  This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More data, more power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. For more information, see our documentation about finding data in long logs (blobs) and the Log Event API. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on Add Your Data page. Notes In partnership with our customers, the New Relic log team has been rapidly innovating our log management capabilities since the initial release in 2019. Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business. To stay up to date the most recent fixes and enhancements, subscribe to our Logs RSS feed. More to come soon!",

You can use the relatedEntities field to see how pairs of entities interact and how they're related. This can help troubleshoot upstream and downstream services and understand how minor issues may have larger repercussions, similar to how service maps can be used. To learn general information about entities, their relationships, and how to use them, see Entities. Relationship types Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source in addition to the one you are currently viewing. Read relationships of an entity You can use NerdGraph to return the relationships between your monitored entities. The following example shows how to query an entity by its specific GUID, using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. New Relic allows you to group entities together in groupings called workloads. This enables better monitoring of the full stack used by a team or project. Here we show you how to use our NerdGraph API to do some workloads-related tasks: Get the workloads of an account Get the list of entities in a workload Get the status of a workload Create a workload Modify a workload Set a static status for a workload Modify the automatic status rules for a workload Duplicate a workload Delete a workload Important You can also use the CLI and Terraform resource to automate these tasks. Get the workloads of an account To get all workloads of an account, use the following GraphQL query and pass the account ID via the id field. In this example, we retrieve three basic fields: guid: the workload GUID. name: the workload name. permalink: the permanent URLs on the New Relic One UI. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collections { guid name permalink } } } } } Copy The response includes this type of data for each workload: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collections\": [ ..., { \"guid\": \"MTY...NTY\", \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Fulfillment Chain\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTY...NTY\" }, ... ] } } } }, \"extensions\": { ... } } Copy Get the list of entities in a workload You can get the entities that belong to a workload with the following query, just by passing the workload GUID (guid) as an argument. In this example we also retrieve some workload metadata: accountId: the workload account. name: the workload name. permalink: the workload permanent URL on the New Relic One UI. alertSeverity: the status of the workload. This value can have up to 10 minutes of delay; if you want to force the calculation of the workload status in query time, please use the Get the status of a workload example. The nested collection, members and results objects, which contain the actual list of entities: The name argument in the collection object takes the value WORKLOAD. count: Number of entities in the workload. { actor { entity(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { accountId name permalink ... on AlertableEntity { alertSeverity } ... on CollectionEntity { collection(name: \"WORKLOAD\") { members { count results { entities { accountId entityType name guid ... on AlertableEntityOutline { alertSeverity } } } } } } } } } Copy The query returns a list of entities that looks like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"entity\": { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"name\": \"Acme Telco - Ecommerce\", \"permalink\": \"https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"collection\": { \"members\": { \"count\": 201, \"results\": { \"entities\": [ { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"CRITICAL\", \"entityType\": \"APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058NDMxOTIwNTg\", \"name\": \"Fulfillment Service\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_HOST_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw3MDQzMzA2NzIyMjk2NDg4Mzc\", \"name\": \"ip-172-31-16-222\" }, { \"accountId\": 1606862, \"alertSeverity\": \"NOT_ALERTING\", \"entityType\": \"INFRASTRUCTURE_AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxJTkZSQXxOQXw1MjMyNzM2ODgzNjAwNjYyMjE1\", \"name\": \"TelcoDT-purchase-log-lambda\" }, ... ] } } } } } } } Copy Get the status of a workload If you want to force the calculation of the status of a workload, you can use the following query, passing the account id (id) as the argument for the account field, and the workload GUID (guid) as the argument for the collection field. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { workload { collection(guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\") { guid status { value } } } } } } Copy And this is what you'll get in the response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"workload\": { \"collection\": { \"guid\": \"MTYwNjg2MnxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8MTIyMzQ\", \"status\": { \"value\": \"OPERATIONAL\" } } } } } } } Copy Note that the DISRUPTED status value is a synonym for CRITICAL status. Create a workload The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates a workload using the workloadCreate mutation query: mutation { workloadCreate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, workload: { name: \"NAME_OF_WORKLOAD\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'production'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Some details on parts of this query: account: The workload account ID. Workloads can't be moved between accounts, so it's not possible to change this value later. name: A string with a user-friendly name for the workload. scopeAccounts: Scope accounts are the accounts where the entity data is fetched from. Scope accounts must belong to a group under the same parent account or enterprise partnership as the workload account. To define the entities in the workload, you can use one or both of these options: entitySearchQueries: This allows you to dynamically generate an array of entities. A name for each query is not needed. Here's an example dynamic query: (domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'production' Copy entityGuids: This is for choosing specific entity GUIDs for inclusion in the workload. guid: This returns the workload guid. Because NerdGraph provides schema stitching, you can get other details about the workload, like the permalink. Modify a workload To modify a workload, use the workloadUpdate mutation. You must know the workload's guid. The workload account can't be changed. For the fields you can modify, see Create workloads. These additional rules apply: entitySearchQueries: This field must contain all the queries as you expect them to be stored. If you want to add a new query, include it in the query field and don't provide any query id. If you want to modify an existing query, include it in the query field and provide its existing id. If you want to delete an existing query, just don't add any query with that id anymore. Here's an example of the workloadUpdate query: mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"A new name for the workload\", entityGuids: [\"ENTITY_GUID_1\", \"ENTITY_GUID_2\", ...], entitySearchQueries: [ { query: \"(domain = 'INFRA' and type = 'HOST') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, { id: AN_EXISTING_QUERY_ID, query: \"(type = 'SERVICE') and tags.label.environment = 'staging'\" }, ... ], scopeAccounts: { accountIds: [NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_1, NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID_2, ...] } } ) { guid } } Copy Set a static status for a workload You can set up a static status for a workload, which overrides any automatic status calculation. To set a static status, you must know the workload's guid and use the following fields: enabled: Remember to set this field to true to propagate the status value. status: The status value you want to set for this workload. Supported values are OPERATIONAL, DEGRADED or DISRUPTED. description: A text field to provide additional details. mutation { workloadUpdate( guid: \"YOUR_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { statusConfig: { static: { enabled: true, status: DEGRADED, description: \"Game day. Expect some turbulence today between 8 and 9am PST.\" } } } ) { guid updatedAt status { value } } } Copy Modify the automatic status rules for a workload When you create a workload, you can use the statusConfig object to define which automatic rules you want to use to calculate the status of the workload. If you leave the rules array empty, no rules will be set up for your workload. However, if you just don't use the statusConfig object when you create a workload, the following rules will be added by default: \"statusConfig\": { \"automatic\": { \"enabled\": true, \"rules\": [ { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'APM' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'MOBILE' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'BROWSER' and type = 'APPLICATION')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } }, { \"entitySearchQueries\": [{\"query\": \"(domain = 'SYNTH' and type = 'MONITOR')\"}], \"rollup\": { \"strategy\": \"WORST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } ], \"remainingEntitiesRule\": { \"rollup\": { \"groupBy\": \"ENTITY_TYPE\", \"strategy\": \"BEST_STATUS_WINS\", \"thresholdType\": null, \"thresholdValue\": null } } } } Copy This is how you read the configuration: enabled: The automatic status calculation is enabled when this field is set to true. rules: An array of rules. In the default configuration, four rules are set for those entity types that are closer to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services). For each of these groups, the status of the unhealthiest rolls up. remainingEntitiesRule: This is the rule that will apply to all entities that haven't been evaluated in any other rule. In the default configuration, the remaining entities are grouped by entity type, and we make the status of each group to match that of its healthiest entity. If you want to modify these rules, you must use the workloadUpdate mutation, and send the complete new statusConfig object that you want to use. You can disable the automatic status calculation while keeping the configuration, by setting the statucConfig.automatic.enabled to false. Alternatively, you can delete all automatic regular rules by sending an empty array. And you can delete the rule for the remaining entities by just not adding the remainingEntitiesRule object. Duplicate a workload To duplicate a workload you first need to know its guid. In the workloadDuplicate mutation, you must pass as parameters: accountId: The account where you want to create the new workload. sourceGuid: the guid of the workload you want to duplicate. workload.name: Optional. You can specify a name for the new workload. If you don't specify one, the new workload will get the name of the original workload appended with - Copy. After duplicating a workload, you can modify it. mutation { workloadDuplicate( accountId: NEW_WORKLOAD_ACCOUNT_ID, sourceGuid: \"ORIGINAL_WORKLOAD_GUID\", workload: { name: \"New workload\" } ) { guid } } Copy Delete a workload To delete a workload, use the workloadDelete mutation and specify the workload GUID. When you delete a workload, all history and metadata is also deleted.",

You can use the relatedEntities field to see how pairs of entities interact and how they're related. This can help troubleshoot upstream and downstream services and understand how minor issues may have larger repercussions, similar to how service maps can be used. To learn general information about entities, their relationships, and how to use them, see Entities. Relationship types Relationship types provide additional information about how two entities are related. The supported relationship types are: Type Description CALLS The relationship between one service or application calling another. Used to display upstream and downstream services. CONTAINS The relationship and hierarchical use cases common to modern and cloud infrastructure. For example, this could indicate that the HOST contains a container. HOSTS The relationship between an application or process and the system it runs on. SERVES The relationship between a back-end application and the browser application it returns in the response. is The relationship between an entity captured as a separate entity by another telemetry data source in addition to the one you are currently viewing. Read relationships of an entity You can use NerdGraph to return the relationships between your monitored entities.

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey: \"example-route-key\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type config { key routeKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Webhook

{ password username } baseUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an xMatters notification channel An example create mutation for an xMatters notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the policy because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated channels to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "Our Incident Intelligence uses logic to correlate your incidents. We call these logic \"decisions.\" We have built-in decisions and you can create and customize your own on the Incident Intelligence Decisions UI page. The more optimally you configure decisions, the better we will group and correlate your incident events, resulting in reduced noise and increased context for on-call teams. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Our UI shows how each decision correlates incidents. Key concepts Here are some key concepts for understanding our decisions logic: What is \"correlation\" and how does it work? For the incident events being sent into Incident Intelligence from your various alerting engines, the most recently created and active incidents are available for correlation. Correlation occurs between two events whenever the criteria in any decision is met. All the events available for correlation are tested against each other in all possible pair combinations and a \"greedy merge\" is performed. This means that if incident A correlates with B into an issue and incident B correlates with incident C into another issue, then AB and BC will also merge together resulting in a single issue including A, B, and C. What types of logic can be used in a decision? At a high level, decisions allow you to define logic based on time (duration between events), frequency (number of events), context (metadata structure & values), and topology (entity relationships). Review your active decisions Decisions determine how Incident Intelligence correlates incidents together. By default, a broad set of global decisions is enabled when you start using Incident Intelligence. To review existing decisions: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. In the left navigation, under Incident Intelligence, click Decisions. Review the list of active decisions. To see the rule logic that creates correlations between your issues, click the decision. To see examples of incidents the decision correlated, click the Recent correlations tab. Use any of the other options to enable or disable these global decisions. Your decisions will routinely be analyzed for their efficacy as well as other best practices, and recommendations will be attached for review. Correlation statistics Whether you want to use the suggested decisions we provide using our pattern recognition algorithms, or you want to add in your own correlation logic, you'll get insights into your correlation rate, noise reduction improvement, and the number of correlated issues arising, as shown below. From the UI, you can view the underlying NRQL queries and create your own custom charts and dashboards from this data. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Some example statistics from the decisions UI. Some definitions of statistics: Correlation rate: The percentage of the time correlations are occurring versus not. Total correlated issues: Number of issues correlated with another issue. Noise reduction: Total number of issues after correlation divided by the total number of issues before correlation. Correlation reason: Shows which decisions are correlating issues the most. Use suggested decisions Information about the types of suggested decisions: Suggested decisions: The data from your selected sources is continuously inspected for patterns to help reduce noise. Once patterns have been observed in your data, decisions are suggested that would allow these events to correlate in the future. Accelerated suggested decisions: If you have been using New Relic Alerts for a while, when you add alert policies to sources, we're able to use that historical data to accelerate the pattern recognition step and suggest decisions up to 30% faster. To get started, click on a suggested decision, located under the statistics block on the Decisions UI page. You'll see information on the logic behind the suggested decision, why we think it will help you, and the estimated correlation rate for that decision. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Suggested decision block If there isn't enough data to see the correlation rate, a link right below the percentage estimate will guide you to other sources you can add to get stronger results. Note: if you have less than 5000 incidents per month, you probably won't have suggested decisions. To add the suggested decision, click Activate decision and it will appear enabled, alongside the other decisions. If the decision isn't relevant to your needs, click Dismiss. Create custom decisions You can reduce noise and improve correlation by building your own custom decisions. To start building a decision, go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. In the left navigation, under Incident Intelligence, click Decisions, then click Add a decision. Tips on how to use that UI are in the table below. When building a decision, steps 1, 2 and 3 are optional on their own but at least one must be defined in order to create a decision. Option Description Step 1: Filter your data In this step you'll define your filters. Remember correlation occurs between two incidents. If no filters are defined all incoming Incidents will be considered by the decision. Define your filters for the first segment (or bucket) of incidents, and the second segment of Incidents. Types of filter operators range from substring matching to regex matching to help you target the incident events you want and exclude those you don't. All combination of event pairs between segment one and segment two are used in the next steps of the decision. Step 2: Contextual correlation Once you've filtered your data, define the logic used when comparing the incidents' context. You can correlate events based on the following methods: Attribute value comparisons with standard operators Attribute value similarity using similarity algorithms Attribute value regex with capture groups Entire incident comparisons using similarity or clustering algorithms Step 3: Topology correlation Topology correlation is currently in limited release. Contact your account representative to enable this feature. Once enabled, you'll first need to ingest your topology data via our NerdGraph aiTopologyCollector (search for aiTopology in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer). This allows any topology-related decision to be matched with your topology data. Learn more about setting up topology correlation. Give it a name After you configure your decision logic, give it a recognizable name and description. This is used in notifications and other areas of the UI to indicate which decision caused a pair of incidents to be correlated together. Advanced settings Optional. The advanced settings area allows you to further customize how your decision behaves when correlating events. Each setting has a default value so customization is optional. Time window: Sets the maximum time between two incidents created time for them to be eligible for correlation. Issue priority: Overrides the default priority setting (inherit priority) to add higher or lower priority if the Incidents are correlated. Frequency: Modifies the minimum number of incidents that need to meet the rule logic for the decision to trigger. Similarity: If you're using similar to operators in your rule logic, you can choose from a list of algorithms and set its sensitivity. This will apply to all similar to operators in your decision. Similarity algorithms Here are technical details on the similarity algorithms we use: Levenshtein distance This measure is useful for comparing short strings with static schema and fixed length, like host names. Levenshtein distance is also known as edit distance. Details Description How it works The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the minimum number of single-character edits to get from one string to the other. Allowed edit operations are deletion, insertion, and substitution. The default similarity threshold for Applied Intelligence decisions is an edit distance of 3. You can change this in the Advanced mode of the decision builder. When to use it This measure is most useful for comparing relatively short strings with static schema and fixed length. Common applications include spell checkers, computational biology, and speech recognition. Examples number/bumble: 3 (number → bumber → bumblr → bumble) trying/lying: 2 (trying → rying → lying) strong/through: 4 (strong → htrong → throng → throug → through) Potential drawbacks Levenshtein distance is not normalized by default to take into account string lengths. Fuzzy score This metric is useful for comparing same-length strings where the same prefix would be a good indicator of correlation. Details Description How it works The fuzzy score algorithm works by allocating \"points\" for character matches between strings: One point for each matching character Two bonus points for subsequent matches The higher the fuzzy score, the greater the similarity between two strings. When to use it Fuzzy score is most useful for strings that have the same, and relatively short (ideally < 5 character), prefixes. A minimum guaranteed score would be (length(expected prefix) * 3) - 2. Examples Example: Decisions / dcsions d: 1 c: 1 i 1 s: 2 o: 1 n: 1 si: 2 io: 2 on: 2 ns: 2 = 15 points Potential drawbacks If the first character of the first string can't be found in the second string, no points are awarded. Fuzzy wuzzy ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings of similar length. Details Description How it works The fuzzy wuzzy family of similarity measures was developed by SeatGeek to help find tickets for the same event that have different labels across multiple platforms. The fuzzy wuzzy ratio for two strings is expressed as a percentage, where a higher number indicates a more similar string. It's based on the SequenceMatcher algorithm in Python's difflib. When to use it Fuzzy wuzzy ratio is effective for very short (eg. hostname) or very long (eg. event description) strings, especially in comparing strings of similar length. Potential drawbacks This algorithm is too sensitive to be used effectively for 3-10 word strings. One of the other modifications to fuzzy wuzzy (see below) may be a better choice. Fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings of different length. This modification to the fuzzy wuzzy algorithm helps address the effective length limitation. Details Description How it works With fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio, the shorter string is compared to each substring of the same length within the longer string. The score of the “best matching” substring is used to determine the fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio. When to use it Fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio is especially effective for the types of comparisons the basic fuzzy wuzzy algorithm fails at: 3-10 word strings where some significant substrings are likely to be overlapping. Examples For example, between the following strings: DevOps and SRE teams DevOps …”DevOps” (the shorter string, length = 6) would be compared to each substring with length 6 within “DevOps and SRE teams.” Since one of those substrings (“DevOps”) is a perfect match, the fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio for these two strings will be high. Potential drawbacks Where fuzzy wuzzy may be too conservative, fuzzy wuzzy partial match may be more liberal than expected with correlations. You can adjust the threshold in the decision builder according to your needs. Fuzzy wuzzy token set ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings where the information may not be in the same order, and of possible different lengths. It works best for sentences such as messages, descriptions, etc. Details Description How it works The token set ratio algorithm follows a few steps to compare strings: Tokenize each string (eg. “DevOps and SRE teams” → “DevOps” “and” “SRE” “teams”; “SRE team and DevOps engineers” → “SRE” “teams” “and” “DevOps” “engineers”) Combine intersecting tokens into a new string, leaving the remaining tokens. (eg. intersecting: ”DevOps”, “and”, “SRE”; remainder1: “teams”; remainder2: “team”, “engineers”) Alphabetize each token group (eg. “and, DevOps, SRE”, “teams”, engineers, team”) Compare the following pairs of strings: Intersection group Intersection group + remainder1 Intersection group + remainder2 The comparison from these pairs (“best matches”) is the fuzzy wuzzy token set ratio. When to use it This metric is helpful in cases where similar strings may have overlapping words but different construction - for example, event descriptions for different issues with the same resource. Potential drawbacks Where fuzzy wuzzy may be too conservative, fuzzy wuzzy token set match may be more liberal than expected with correlations. You can adjust the threshold in the decision builder according to your needs. Jaro-winkler distance This metric is useful for short strings where identical prefixes are a strong indication of correlation. Details Description How it works This metric uses a scale of 0-1 to indicate the similarity between two strings, where 0 is no similarity (0 matching characters between strings) and 1 is an exact match. Jaro-Winkler similarity takes into account: matching: two characters that are the same and in similar positions in the strings. transpositions: matching characters that are in different sequence order in the strings. prefix scale: the Jaro-Winkler distance is adjusted favorably if strings match from the beginning (a prefix is up to 4 characters). When to use it This metric is fairly tolerant of transpositions, but transpositions further apart in the string are less useful. A generally-safe number to use for Jaro-Winkler similarity in moderate to long strings is 0.9; you could use ~ 0.85 in cases where more leniency is okay (if you have other, more specific logic in the decision). Cosine distance This measure is most commonly used to compare large blocks of text (for example, incident descriptions) and provides an easy visualization of similarity. Details Description How it works For each text block you're comparing, a vector is calculated to represent the count of each unique word in the block. The cosine distance of the resulting vectors is their dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes. When to use it This measure is most useful to compare long blocks of text, specifically when the comparison is meant to consider the text as a whole, and not differences or misspellings in individual words. Examples It is not length of life, but depth of life. Depth of life does not depend on length. Copy Here are the word counts for these sentences: it 1 0 is 0 1 not 1 1 length 1 1 of 2 1 life 2 1 but 1 0 depth 1 1 does 0 1 depend 0 1 on 0 1 And here are those counts represented as a vector: [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] Copy The cosine distance of these vectors is about 0.9 (1 is the highest similarity). Potential drawbacks Cosine distance is less useful for situations where small character differences in words are insignificant. Also, cosine distance ignores word order in the text blocks. For more information on cosine distance implementation, see this detailed walkthrough. Hamming distance This measure is useful for shorter text with static schema, but it works only for same-length strings. Details Description When to use it Hamming distance requires the compared strings to be of equal length. This is a useful similarity metric for situations where the difference between two strings may be due to typos, or where you want to compare two attributes with known lengths. For example: Low Disk Space in application myapp in datacenter us01 If you wanted to be tolerant to datacenter changes, the hamming distance should be set to 4. An average use case for Hamming distance would be around 2-3. Examples A simpler version of \"edit distance\" metrics like Levenshtein distance, the Hamming distance between two strings is the number of characters in the string that don't match (in the same position). For example, in the strings below, the Hamming distance is 2: flowers / florets Copy Potential drawbacks In the example above, if the application name changes instead of the datacenter, a correlation would also be created. As the distance grows, the usefulness of Hamming Distance plummets. For this reason, for anything remotely more complicated than being tolerant to 1-2 character substitutions (or if the string lengths will not match), a different similarity measurement should be used. Jaccard distance This measure is useful for comparing large blocks of text, like descriptions or entire incidents. Details Description How it works The distance, denoted as a percentage (0 being completely similar; 1 being totally dissimilar) is calculated with the following formula: 1 - [(# of characters in both sets) / (# of characters in either set) * 100] Copy In other words, the Jaccard distance is the number of shared characters divided by the total number of characters (shared and un-shared). A Jaccard distance of 0.1 means that 10% or fewer characters between two incidents are different. When to use it Jaccard distance is very easy to interpret and especially useful in cases with large data sets. For example, in comparing the similarity between two entire incidents (as opposed to one attribute). Potential drawbacks It's less effective for small data sets or situations with missing data. Also, different permutations of the character set don't affect Jaccard distance, so care should be taken to prevent false positives. Regex operators When building a decision, available operators include: contains (regex): used in Step 1: Filter your data. regular expression match: used in Step 2: Contextual correlation. The decision builder follows the standards outlined in these documents for regular expressions. Regex in Step 1 In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute value (the data you’re evaluating) must be matched by the regular expression provided. Captured groups can be used but are not explicitly evaluated. For instance, if the attribute value is foobarbaz, these examples would meet the criteria and test as true: foo.* ^.*baz \\w+ Regex in Step 2 In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute values for incident 1 and incident 2 must be included in the match. Also, each captured group (expressions in ( ) parentheses) must exist in both values (incident 1 and incident 2 attributes), and have the same value: The number of captured groups must be equal for both incident attributes. Each group must be equal to the corresponding group between attribute values: the value of the first captured group in the incident 1 attribute value is equal to the value of the first captured group in the incident 2 attribute. For instance, if attribute value 1 is abc-123-xyz and attribute value 2 is abc-777-xyz, then (\\w+)-(?:\\w+)-(\\w+) would meet the criteria: The whole value is matched by the expression. The first and third captured groups have the same respective values. The second group is not captured using ?:, which allows the whole value to match but isn’t used in the capture group comparison. About flags No flags are enabled by default. Some useful flags to include in regular expressions in the decision builder are: CASE_INSENSITIVE: (?i) MULTILINE: (?m) DOTALL: (?s) See field detail for more notes on the function and implementation of each of these flags. Correlation assistant You can use the correlation assistant to more quickly analyze incidents, create decision logic, and test the logic with a simulation. To use the correlation assistant: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Overview, then click the Incidents tab. Check the boxes of incidents you'd like to correlate. Then, at the bottom of the incident list, click Correlate incidents. For best results for correlating incidents, select common attributes with a low frequency percentage. Learn more about using frequency. Click Simulate to see the likely effect of your new decision on the last week of your data. Click on examples of correlation pairs and determine of those correlations are desired. If you like what's been simulated, click Next, and then name and describe your decision. If the simulation result shows too many potential incidents, you may want to choose a different set of attributes and incidents for your decision and run another simulation. Learn more about simulation. Attribute analysis Here are explanations of the two types of attribute analysis displayed in the UI: Common attributes: This analysis simply highlights attributes and values that are the exact same between all selected incidents. Similar attributes: Similarity analysis uses the Levenshtein algorithm with a distance of 3 to find attributes whose values would be the same if 3 or less character changes are performed. Other details: Numerical values as well as single character values are filtered out of the results. Requires two incidents to be selected. Similarity analysis is not performed when 3 or more incidents are selected. To create the best decisions, we recommend choosing common attributes that have a lower frequency in your incidents. Here are tips for understanding how choosing low or high frequency attributes affects your decisions: Low frequency: As an example, an attribute with a 0% in the frequency column is likely a unique identifier or an attribute that only recently reported in your data in the last month. Choosing low frequency attributes may correlate few events. High frequency: On the other end, an attribute with 100% frequency would be one that is present on all your data. Choosing these attributes would correlate all of your events together. By default, the attributes are sorted by frequency with the least frequently reported attributes at the top. Click an attribute's frequency percentage to get more information about the distribution of values we've seen reported for that attribute in the last month. Tips on using simulation Using a set of incidents, the correlation assistant identifies common attributes among those incidents as well as attributes with similar values. Select attributes you believe are good indicators that events should correlate and then simulate the decision. Simulation will test the logic against the last week of your data and show you how many correlations would have happened, in addition to actual examples to inspect. If the simulation looks good, continue creating your real decision. If the simulation doesn't show examples of useful correlations, choose a different set of attributes, and run the simulation again. Here’s a breakdown of the decision preview information displayed when you create a simulation: Potential correlation rate: The percentage of tested incidents this decision would have affected. Total created incidents: The number of incidents tested by this decision. Total estimated correlated incidents: The estimated number of incidents this decision would have correlated. Incident examples: A list of incident pairs this decision would have correlated. You can click on these to see a side by side comparison of all attributes and values to help you determine if the correlation is desired or not. Run the simulation with different attributes as many times as you need until you see results you like. When you’re ready, follow the UI prompts to save your decision. Topology correlation What do we mean by “topology”? For New Relic's Applied Intelligence, topology is a representation of your service map: how the services and resources in your infrastructure relate to one another. When you create a custom decision, you can use our topology correlation, which finds relationships between incident sources to determine if incidents should correlate. Topology correlation is designed to improve the quality of your correlations and the speed at which they're found. Requirements Topology correlation is currently in limited release. Requirements: Given access to topology feature by a New Relic representative Limit of 10K vertices per New Relic organization per environment How does topology correlation work? In this service map, the hosts and apps are the vertices, and the lines showing their relationships are the edges. Topology correlation relies on two main concepts: Vertex: A vertex represents a monitored entity: it's the source from which your incident events are coming from, or describing a problematic symptom about. A vertex has attributes (key/value pairs) configured for it, like entity GUIDs or other IDs, which allow it be associated with incoming incident events. Edges: An edge is a connection between two vertices. Edges describe the relationship between vertices. To set up your topology, you'll use our NerdGraph API. But first, it may help to understand how topology is used to correlate incidents: First, New Relic gathers all relevant incidents. This includes incidents where decision-logic steps 1 and 2 are true, and that are also within the defined time window in advanced settings. In this example, all of the incidents in the dotted-line selection have met these requirements: they've gone through the decision logic in steps 1 and 2, and all contextual comparisons made in decision logic step 2 are true. Next, we attempt to associate each incident to a vertex in your topology graph using a vertex's defining attributes and the available attributes on the incident. Here's an example of the steps for associating incidents with the information in the topology graph. Next, the pairs of vertices which were associated with incidents are tested using the \"topologically dependent\" operator to determine if these vertices are connected to each other. This operator checks to see if there is any path in the graph that connect the two vertices within 5 hops. The incidents are then correlated and the issues are merged together. Add attributes to incident events Incidents are connected to vertices using a vertex's defining attributes (in the example topology under Topology explained, each vertex has a defining attribute \"CID\" with a unique value). Next, Applied Intelligence finds a vertex that matches the attribute. If the defining attribute you'd like to use on your vertices isn't already on your incident events there are a few ways to add it: Tag your entities in New Relic: By tagging your entities, those tags will enrich the incident events generated by Alerts. For example, if you've tagged your entities with CID and their corresponding unique values then you can have defining attributes on your vertex as follows: 'newrelic/tags/CID' : CID_VALUE Facet your data: Creating NRQL alert conditions with one or more facets defined will group your data by attribute. Also, incident events emitted will be enriched with those attributes and values. For incidents, faceted attributes follow the same format: newrelic/tags/ATTRIBUTE_NAME Create or view topology To set up your topology or view existing topology, see the NerdGraph topology tutorial.",

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "body": "Our log management capabilities help you to collect, process, explore, query, and alert on your log data. To get your logs into New Relic, you can: Use your existing log forwarding solution to collect your logs and extend the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Use our infrastructure agent as a lightweight data collector, without having to use additional software. Use our Log API to forward your logs via HTTP. Use syslog protocols to forward your logs via a TCP endpoint. How it works The following diagram shows the lifecycle of a log message for an app, from enrichment with APM agent metadata (contextual logging), to formatting and forwarding the log data to New Relic. This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through New Relic. Standard log formatters transform log events into meaningful output (such as text files) that can be used by downstream people and processes. The NewRelicFormatter transforms log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. These files contain log information and extended metadata. When you configure your log forwarder (our infrastructure monitoring agent, Fluentd, Logstash, etc.), you can also extend and enrich your log data. By configuring logs in context, the log enricher links the formatted log data with additional transaction information from your application or host. Now your log files are enriched with enhanced metadata and contextual logging data. Your log forwarder sends the files to our logging endpoint for processing. From there you can use our log management capabilities to view, query, set up alerts, and more in New Relic. Get started with log forwarders To forward your logs to New Relic with enriched metadata: If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Have your New Relic account's license key. Install a compatible log forwarder. Ensure that outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. Use the DNS name log-api.newrelic.com or log-api.eu.newrelic.com for configuration. For apps monitored by a New Relic APM agent, configure logs in context. Log forwarding options Use any of these solutions to forward your logs to New Relic. Recommended: Infrastructure monitoring agent Amazon: AWS CloudWatch plugin AWS FireLens plugin AWS Kinesis Firehose AWS Lambda for sending logs from S3 Microsoft: Azure ARM template Other log forwarding plugins: Fluent Bit plugin Fluentd plugin Heroku log streaming Kubernetes plugin Logstash plugin Vector plugin TCP endpoint In some situations you may not have log forwarders; for example, with CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services. You can use syslog protocols such as rsyslog and syslog-ng, and forward your logs to New Relic via a TCP endpoint. Log API If you prefer to connect to New Relic without installing a plugin, we offer an HTTP input integration. This option sends your monitored log data directly to New Relic via the Log API. What's next? After you enable your log forwarder, make the most of your data in New Relic with our log management capabilities: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data if you are forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent.

SLA tips Comments Requirements When using the cURL command examples, be sure to replace the placeholder text with your account ID, an API key, and the application ID. Time ranges You are not limited to standard day, week, or month time ranges. For example, you can extract metric data for a \"holiday weekend\" from 12/23 to 12/26 or \"the 20 minutes after our site had problems\" or whatever other period interests you. UTC XML time format You must specify the time in UTC XML format, so be sure to adjust for your time zone compared to UTC. For example, New Relic starts at 16:00:00 on the day before the selected data, since New Relic headquarters are in UTC-8. Summary reports When requesting metrics to use with summary reports, include the query string parameter summarize=true (v2) or summary=1 (v1) as shown in the examples. Scaled statistics Your report has some statistics that are scaled in the SLA reports in New Relic's user interface. New Relic changes the scale of page views in your report to show small numbers. Depending on your traffic, typically it might be displayed in thousands, millions, or billions. Recommendation: To avoid a string of zeroes, divide this number appropriately for your own purposes. End user statistics End user statistics will reflect only the calls in which the agent gathered browser data. For example, end user stats may not appear in situations such as: Browser types Clients (they might have disabled the JavaScript agent, or blocked traffic to New Relic sites for JavaScript code's location Transactions not in one of those categories, in case the page load did not complete for any reason This is why there are fewer (sometimes many fewer) page views in the End User (browser) data section than in the App server data section. Examples The following sections contain code examples to acquire the data for values described above for the Daily (24hr) SLA statistics in the default GMT/UTC time zone.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2).

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

      "body": "This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to get your mobile application's overall and version-specific crash count and crash rate, which appear on the Summary page in the upper right corner. These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

You must also provide APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, and the monitoring enabled BOOLEAN (true or false) even if they are not being modified. curl -X PUT \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"application\": { \"name\": \"name\", \"settings\": { \"app_apdex_threshold\": APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"end_user_apdex_threshold\": BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"enable_real_user_monitoring\": BOOLEAN } } }' Copy This is the equivalent of using the APM UI to change the displayed app name. This will not change the app identifier name under which your data will be collected. It will only change the app name that appears in the New Relic user interface.

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

      "body": "This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to get your mobile application's overall and version-specific crash count and crash rate, which appear on the Summary page in the upper right corner. These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

      "body": "Here are examples of how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to add apps to browser monitoring or to get a list of your browser apps for a specific API key. This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Important When you add a browser app via API (v2), you can only instrument basic page load timing. To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, set up single page app monitoring via another method. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser applications > POST create. Use the following command: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"browser_application\": { \"name\": ${STRING} } }' Copy The API returns an array of data where the element is a browser application and the data associated with it: { \"browser_application\": { \"id\": \"integer\", \"name\": \"string\", \"browser_monitoring_key\": \"string\", \"loader_script\": \"string\" } Copy API (v2) output Description Browser app id (integer) This is the unique identification code for each app in New Relic One. App name (string) This is the app's name as it appears in the New Relic One. The browser_monitoring_key (string) This a unique key that is linked to (but is not the same as) the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your browser-monitored apps, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List. Use the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy You can use the results to verify the account or name, and to get a copy of the loader script for the app, if needed. View specific browser apps View by name: To view a specific browser app if you know its name, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${NAME} with your app's name in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"filter[name]=${NAME}\" Copy View by browser application ID: To view a specific browser app if you know its ID, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${ID} with your browser application ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=${ID}' Copy View multiple browser apps: To get information for multiple apps, separate the name or ID values with a comma in these commands; for example: -d 'filter[ids]=12345,23456' Copy",

      "body": "The metric timeslice data presented on the Browser page load time chart on your application's Summary page will depend on your web app's configuration. Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. Use the following command to obtain this. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_network_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Page rendering time Page rendering time is a derived value. To calculate it, use this equation: \"Page rendering\" time = EndUser:average_fe_response_time - EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:average_fe_response_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_fe_response_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. DOM processing time The EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time is the time spent in the browser to parse and interpret the HTML. This is measured by the browser's DOM Content event. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds. EndUser:call_count curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count' Copy Request queuing time The EndUser/RB:average_queue_time is the wait time between the web server and the application code. Large numbers indicate a busy application server. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_queue_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. The request queuing time is not included in the calculation of averages. New Relic includes it in this chart as a convenience.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2). It does not work with the following: Deployment API Infrastructure API for alerts Insights API Insights Dashboard API Partner API Plugin API Synthetics API",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown.

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

For general guidelines for setting secure credentials and setting them in the UI, see Secure credentials. Requirements and rules For general rules about this feature, see the secure credentials requirements. API requirements and rules include: See general Synthetics REST API requirements. An account's rate of requests is limited to three requests per second. Requests that exceed this threshold will return a 429 response code. A key's value cannot be accessed via the API; an unauthorized user would not have access to the secure key values. API examples Add a secure credential To send a secure credential to your New Relic account, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials with a JSON payload that describes the secure credential. Here's an example: { \"key\": string [required, 1-64 characters uppercase], \"value\": string [required, 1-3,000 characters], \"description\": string [optional] } Copy Here's an example of doing this with a curl command: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials \\ -d '{ \"key\": \"MYKEY\", \"value\": \"my value\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY\" }' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created secure credential specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 303 See Other: The specified key already exists. The returned location header will contain the URI to the key. 400 Bad Request: Key too long or missing, value too long or missing, non-parsable JSON payload. Get all secure credentials To view a list of all the secure credentials in your New Relic account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"secureCredentials\": [ { \"key\": \"MYKEY1\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY1\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"lastUpdated\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\" }, { \"key\": \"MYKEY2\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY2\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"lastUpdated\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\" } ], \"count\": 2 } Copy Get a specific secure credential To view a single secure credential, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"key\": string, \"description\": string, \"createdAt\": date,​ \"lastUpdated\": date } Copy An invalid key will return 404 Not Found: The specified key doesn't exist.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "With the Errors UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page Important As of October 1, 2021, the APM Errors (classic) UI will be discontinued in favor of the New Relic One APM Errors UI. For more details, see our Explorers Hub post. To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

      "body": "With the Errors UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page Important As of October 1, 2021, the APM Errors (classic) UI will be discontinued in favor of the New Relic One APM Errors UI. For more details, see our Explorers Hub post. To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit.

      "body": "Parsing is the process of splitting unstructured log data into attribute/value pairs. You can use these attributes to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. New Relic parses log data according to rules. Learn how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule is created with matching criteria that determines which logs the rule will attempt to parse. To simplify the matching process, we recommend adding a logtype attribute to your logs. However, you are not limited to using logtype; any attribute can be used as matching criteria. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. Parsing occurs in the pipeline before data enrichments take place. Be careful when defining the matching criteria for a parsing rule. If the criteria is based on an attribute that doesn't exist untail after parsing or enrichment take place, that data won't be present in the logs when matching occurs. As a result, no parsing will happen. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a standard parsing rulesets. See Built-in parsing rules to learn what fields are parsed for each rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. To create and manage your own, custom parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing, then click Create parsing rule. Enter the parsing rule's name. Choose an attribute and value to match on. Write your Grok pattern and test the rule. To learn about Grok and custom parsing rules, read our blog post about how to parse logs with Grok patterns. Enable and save the custom parsing rule. To view the list of custom parsing rules: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. To view existing parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. Troubleshooting If parsing is not working the way you intended, it may be due to: Logic: The parsing rule matching logic does not match the logs you want. Timing: If your parsing matching rule targets a value that doesn't exist yet, it will fail. This can occur if the value is added later in the pipeline as part of the enrichment process. Limits: There is a fixed amount of time available every minute to process logs via parsing, patterns, drop filters, etc. If the maximum amount of time has been spent, parsing will be skipped for additional log event records. To resolve these problems, create or adjust your custom parsing rules.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this... Change how the thread profile information appears Select your choices of available options in the Tree settings, and select Refresh tree. Change how much information appears Select the Expand or Collapse options above the call tree, or select the name or arrow on any line in the call tree. View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same.

(For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution.

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent.

Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent. PHP Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql Threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration is not possible for the PHP agent. Python Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",

Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options.

Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off.

View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent. PHP Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql Threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration is not possible for the PHP agent. Python Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options.

Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK.

If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off.

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this... Change how the thread profile information appears Select your choices of available options in the Tree settings, and select Refresh tree.

View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

Depending on the specifics of your production systems, this measurement of time may or may not include an actual queue that requests enter. It may also represent other functions (such as load balancing or internal network latency). Use request queuing to identify scaling problems Tracking time spent in request queuing is useful for identifying certain types of performance and scaling problems; for example: When your front-end web server is spending time waiting for application workers to become available When extra time is spent warming up application workers after a deploy or restart You must configure your New Relic agent and server to report request queuing. Then the information will appear in the selected application's Requests time chart for web transactions (from APM's Applications list, select the app), as well as other places in the user interface. The chart's legend indicates which color represents request queueing. Apdex calculations Request queuing is the time from when the browser requests content to the time it receives the content. Since your Apdex score will reflect these calculations, you can select whether to report request queue time separately or not. For more information, see Agent configuration. Clock skew If the front-end web server (such as Nginx) and your application do not reside on the same physical server, reported request queuing may be affected by clock skew. NTP provides an excellent way to keep server clocks in sync. However, they still will drift relative to each other. Since New Relic agents rely on a timestamp set by the front-end server, it may over- or under-report request queuing if the clock on that server is not closely synchronized with the clock on the app server. This may seem like a major problem with the feature; however, clock skew is unlikely to result in sudden spikes in reported request queuing. Sudden spikes generally occur when an app is restarted or becomes overloaded with requests. Our experience is that request queue reporting can be useful to identify real performance problems, but be sure to consider clock skew when interpreting this data.",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

      "body": "APM tracks the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application. We call this portion of your request's life cycle request queuing. Depending on the specifics of your production systems, this measurement of time may or may not include an actual queue that requests enter. It may also represent other functions (such as load balancing or internal network latency). Use request queuing to identify scaling problems Tracking time spent in request queuing is useful for identifying certain types of performance and scaling problems; for example: When your front-end web server is spending time waiting for application workers to become available When extra time is spent warming up application workers after a deploy or restart You must configure your New Relic agent and server to report request queuing. Then the information will appear in the selected application's Requests time chart for web transactions (from APM's Applications list, select the app), as well as other places in the user interface. The chart's legend indicates which color represents request queueing. Apdex calculations Request queuing is the time from when the browser requests content to the time it receives the content. Since your Apdex score will reflect these calculations, you can select whether to report request queue time separately or not. For more information, see Agent configuration. Clock skew If the front-end web server (such as Nginx) and your application do not reside on the same physical server, reported request queuing may be affected by clock skew. NTP provides an excellent way to keep server clocks in sync. However, they still will drift relative to each other. Since New Relic agents rely on a timestamp set by the front-end server, it may over- or under-report request queuing if the clock on that server is not closely synchronized with the clock on the app server. This may seem like a major problem with the feature; however, clock skew is unlikely to result in sudden spikes in reported request queuing. Sudden spikes generally occur when an app is restarted or becomes overloaded with requests. Our experience is that request queue reporting can be useful to identify real performance problems, but be sure to consider clock skew when interpreting this data.",

      "body": "Information about Trace API data requirements, including: Data specifications and max limits Required metadata (headers, query parameters) Response validation details This document applies to the Trace API overall. For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoints All trace data is sent via HTTPS POST to a Trace API endpoint. We have a few endpoints, depending on your setup: Default Trace API endpoint: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 EU data centers: https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1 (see other EU endpoints). Infinite Tracing: when you complete the Trace observer setup, you get a custom YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value to use as an endpoint. If you're using an integration that uses the Trace API (for example, these integrations), you must configure that integration with that endpoint. You will also want to adjust the sampling of your tracing service to send us 100% of spans. For FedRAMP, see FedRAMP endpoints. Data formats Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute Description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from APM agents. The attributes in the table below are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Restricted attribute description entity.guid string Unique identifier for the entity associated with this span. entity.name string Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type string Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Important Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires a license key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} Copy There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Copy Data limits Distributed tracing rate limits are set per account and data type. For details about data limits, see New Relic data usage limits and policies. When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' Copy To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute. Minute Spans sent to API Total for past 10 minutes 8:59 60,000 600,000 9:00 40,000 580,000 9:01 50,000 570,000 9:02 250,000 760,000 9:03 220,000 920,000 9:04 125,000 985,000 9:05 70,000 995,000 9:06 50,000 985,000 9:07 40,000 965,000 9:08 40,000 945,000 9:09 40,000 925,000",

      "body": "If you want to create your own tracing implementation, you can use our Trace API. This doc explains how to send traces in our general format, aka new-relic format. (To send Zipkin-format data, see Zipkin.) Get started Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, our new-relic format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint. Before using the Trace API, you should decide whether you want to use Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, follow one of these paths: Want to use Infinite Tracing? Follow the Set up a trace observer instructions. That walks you through creating a trace observer and sending a sample payload to the trace observer endpoint. Don't want Infinite Tracing? See how to send a sample payload (below). Send sample trace payload (non-Infinite Tracing) The following explains how to send a standard (non-Infinite Tracing) payload to the Trace API using our newrelic format. Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Insert that key into the following JSON and then send the JSON to our endpoint. Note: if you have a EU New Relic account, use the EU endpoint instead. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"ABC\", \"attributes\": { \"duration.ms\": 12.53, \"name\": \"/home\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"123456\", \"id\": \"DEF\", \"attributes\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\", \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", \"host\": \"host456.example.com\", \"duration.ms\": 2.97, \"name\": \"/auth\", \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" } } ] } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Tip If you're sending more than one POST, change the trace.id to a unique value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same trace.id may result in fragmented traces in the UI. If your test returned HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted, go to our UI to see a query of your test data using the span attribute service.name = Test Service A. Tip Traces may take up to one minute to be processed by both the trace observer and the Trace API. Trace API payload (New Relic format) The Trace API JSON payload is an array of objects, with each object representing a single trace. Each of these objects requires a spans key and may also include a common key. spans (required) contains an array of objects, with each object representing a span. common (optional) shares information across multiple spans. The Span object in the spans array field type description required default id string Unique identifier for this span. yes N/A trace.id string Unique identifier shared by all spans within a single trace. yes N/A timestamp long Span start time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. no Current time in UTC timezone attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add more details about a span. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Requests without the required keys above will be rejected, and an NrIntegrationError will be generated. The common object (optional) field type description required default attributes object Any set of key: value pairs that add common details about spans in the payload. If a span contains an attribute that has been set in common, the key in the span attributes object will take precedence. duration.ms, name, and parent.id are strongly recommended to add. no N/A Highly recommended attributes While not required, these attributes should be included for the best experience with your data in the attributes object for each span. attribute default description duration.ms float none Duration of this span in milliseconds. name string none The name of this span. parent.id string none The id of the caller of this span. Value is null if this is the root span. Traces without a root span will not be displayed. service.name string none The name of the entity that created this span. Reserved attributes These attributes are currently reserved for internal New Relic usage. While they are not explicitly blocked, we recommend not using them. attribute default description entity.name string service.name This is derived from the service.name attribute. entity.type string service The entity type is assumed to be a service. entity.guid string None The entity.guid is a derived value that uniquely identifies the entity in New Relic's backend. Other attributes You can add any arbitrary attributes you want in the attributes object in either common or each span object, with the exception of the restricted attributes. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Requirements and guidelines for trace JSON using the newrelic format: Each JSON payload is an array of objects. Each object should contain a required spans key. Each object can contain an optional common key. Use this if you want to share information across multiple spans in a object. Any keys on a span have precedence over the same key in the common block. The value for a spans key is a list of span objects. Certain attributes are required, and must be included either in the optional common block, or in each span. Recommended and custom attributes can be optionally included in a list of key-value pairs under a key named attributes, in the optional common block and/or in each span. In the following example POST, there are two spans, both of which have the trace.id 12345 and the custom attribute host: host123.example.com. The first span has no parent.id, so that is the root of the trace; the second span's parent.id points to the ID of the first. [ { \"common\": { \"attributes\": { \"host\": \"host123.example.com\" } }, \"spans\": [ { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"abc\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834823, \"attributes\": { \"user.email\": \"bob@newr.com\", \"service.name\": \"my-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"my-span\" } }, { \"trace.id\": \"12345\", \"id\": \"def\", \"timestamp\": 1603336834899, \"attributes\": { \"parent.id\": \"abc\", \"service.name\": \"second-service\", \"duration.ms\": 750, \"name\": \"second-span\" } } ] } ] Copy To learn how to control how spans appear in New Relic (for example, adding errors or setting a span as a datastore span), see Decorate spans.

      "body": "If you want to create your own tracing implementation, you can use our Trace API. This doc explains how to send Zipkin-format trace data to our Trace API. (For our general data format, see New Relic format.) Zipkin version requirements The Trace API supports data from Zipkin JSON v2 (or higher) without any modification. For details on this version, see Zipkin v2 release details and the Zipkin v2 schema. Overview of using the Trace API Using our Trace API is as simple as: Sending trace data in the expected format (in this case, zipkin format). Sending that data to the appropriate endpoint Our send-data instructions have options for enabling Infinite Tracing. To learn more about this, see Intro to Infinite Tracing and Sampling considerations. To get started using the Trace API, choose an option: Send a sample trace: This shows a curl example of sending a trace to New Relic. This is useful for understanding how the Trace API works, and to verify you're seeing data in New Relic. Report data from existing Zipkin instrumentation: if you have an existing Zipkin implementation, you can simply change the endpoint of where your data gets sent. Send sample Zipkin trace payload This section describes how to send a simple Zipkin-format trace to our Trace API via curl request. You might choose to do this in order to learn how our API works and to verify that data is showing up in New Relic before doing in-depth instrumentation. To get started sending a sample payload: (Optional, to enable Infinite Tracing) First, you must set up a trace observer. That procedure includes instructions for sending a sample trace using our general new-relic format. When you get to that step, return here to instead learn how to send a Zipkin-format trace. Send a Zipkin-format payload following the instructions below. Send Zipkin-format payload To send a sample Zipkin-format trace: Get the license key for the account you want to report data to. You'll be executing a curl request, below. Notes on this: Replace the license key placeholder with your license key. If you're using Infinite Tracing, use the YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value in place of the standard endpoint. If you want to send more than one post, change the trace ID to a different value. Sending the same payload or span id multiple times for the same traceId may result in fragmented traces in the UI. curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Api-Key: $NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' \\ -H 'Data-Format: zipkin' \\ -H 'Data-Format-Version: 2' \\ -X POST \\ -d '[ { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"id\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"post\", \"duration\": 508068, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-1\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { } }, { \"traceId\": \"test-zipkin-trace-id-1\", \"parentId\": \"3e0f5885710776cd\", \"id\": \"asdf9asdn123lkasdf\", \"kind\": \"CLIENT\", \"name\": \"service 2 span\", \"duration\": 2019, \"localEndpoint\": { \"serviceName\": \"service-2\", \"ipv4\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 8080 }, \"tags\": { \"error.message\": \"Invalid credentials\" } } ]' 'https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1' Copy Within a minute, the trace should be available in the our distributed tracing UI. To find it, run a query for the trace.id. In this example, it was test-zipkin-trace-id-1. Note that you search by the transformed attribute of trace.id (not traceId). To learn more: Learn where Trace API data shows up in the UI. Send data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation. Learn how to decorate spans by adding tags. This helps you customize how traces are displayed in our UI for a richer, more helpful experience. Learn about general endpoint information (data limits, required metadata, and response validation). Learn about how Zipkin data is transformed and stored in our format. If you don't see your trace data, see Troubleshooting. Send data from existing Zipkin instrumentation Preliminary notes: If you want to enable Infinite Tracing, you first must set up a trace observer. It can be helpful to first send a sample payload to verify things are working properly. To report data from an existing Zipkin instrumentation, you'll point the Zipkin tracer at the appropriate Trace API endpoint with some required request metadata. You can send the required metadata as headers or query parameters (some Zipkin tracer versions don't allow specifying HTTP headers). Here's an example of what it might look like to create a Zipkin OkHttpSender in Java configured for the Trace API: OkHttpSender.create(\"https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1?Api-Key=NEW_RELIC_INSERT_API_KEY&Data-Format=zipkin&Data-Format-Version=2\"); Copy Note that if you were using Infinite Tracing, or had an EU-region New Relic account, the endpoint would be different. For an explanation of Api-Key and the other metadata, see Request metadata. Transformation of Zipkin data To create a consistent search/query experience, some Zipkin data will be transformed to match New Relic attribute naming. For more on how we store and structure trace data, see How distributed tracing works. Zipkin tag Stored in New Relic as... Details traceId trace.id Unique identifier for a trace. id id Unique identifier for a span. parentId parent.id Identifier of the upstream span that called the service. kind kind Either Client or Server. name name Name of span. duration duration.ms Zipkin v2 spans must have durations specified in microseconds, and will be converted to milliseconds. localEndpoint: serviceName service.name We use the Zipkin v2 service name to identify the entity that created this span. localEndpoint: port localEndpoint.port All values in the localEndpoint object will be flattened to a span attribute called localEndpoint.key tags reported as attributes Key:value pairs in the tags object in Zipkin v2 will be written as span attributes. annotations not supported We do not currently support annotations in the Trace API. Spans will not be rejected if they contain annotations, but the annotations data will not be written. Add other tags/attributes You can add any tags you want to the tags block, with the exception of the restricted tags. For example, you might want to add attributes like customer.id or user.id to help you analyze your trace data. Tags will be converted to New Relic attributes. To learn how to control how spans appear in New Relic (for example, adding errors or setting a span as a datastore span), see Decorate spans.",

      "body": "The REST API endpoints allow you to create conditions for your policies. This glossary contains the names and descriptions of each of the fields that you can use to define or update a condition. Required and optional fields The API includes five types of New Relic Alerts conditions: APM External services NRQL Synthetic monitoring Plugins All of the fields used with a specific condition type are required except for these optional fields: enabled (defaults to false) runbook_url user_defined Field definitions Not every field listed in this glossary is required for every condition type. The condition type for which a field must be used is listed in each description. aggregation_delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics). CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer value. The timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point is received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using the EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. Used for: NRQL conditions aggregation_window Streaming alerts gather data together into specific amounts of time before running the function in the NRQL query. These windows of time are customizable. The default is 1 minute. The maximum is 15 minutes. Data points are collected together based on their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Aggregation window field. close_violations_on_expiration When true, this closes all currently open violations when no signal is heard within the expiration_duration time. The default is false. condition_scope This field allows you to scope a condition to either a JVM instance or to a whole application. This may be one of the strings: instance application Used for: Conditions Entity conditions For instance-based and JVM health metrics, see also violation_close_timer. enabled This is the status of your alert condition and is optional. The default is false. This field may be used to enable or disable a condition for maintenance or testing periods. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions entities This is an array of entity IDs identifying the objects that will be monitored with your condition. These may be application IDs, browser IDs, plugin IDs, key transaction IDs, external service IDs, etc. These are entered as a series of comma-separated integers if there is more than one. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions evaluation_offset Deprecated in favor of aggregation_delay. The offset is how long we wait for late data before evaluating each aggregation window. Waiting longer gives a more accurate signal but increases latency. The default is 3 minutes. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Offset evaluation by field. expected_groups This is the number of groups you expect to see at any given time. It is used in combination with the ignore_overlap option. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions expiration_duration How long to wait, in seconds, after the last data point is received by our platform before considering the signal as lost. This is based on the time when data arrives and not on data timestamps. The default is null. Add a value to enable loss of signal detection. external_service_url This is the URL of the external service to be monitored. This string must not include the protocol. For example, use example.com, not https://example.com. Used for: External service conditions fill_option For sporadic data, you can avoid false alerts by filling the gaps (empty windows) with synthetic data. none: (Default) Use this if you don’t want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won’t be in violation. static: Use this if you’d like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they’re evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. last_value: Use this to insert the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. In the UI, under Advanced signal settings, this is the Fill data gaps with field. fill_value This is the value used by the fill_option custom value. The default is 0. ignore_overlap If disabled, this looks for a convergence (or overlapping) of groups. If the condition is looking for two or more groups, and the returned values can't be separated into that number of distinct groups, then that will also produce a violation. This type of overlap event is represented on a chart by group bands touching. Used for: NRQL outlier conditions metric The metric field is used for three alert categories. The exact parameters available for use depend on the setting in the type field. These are listed below according to their alert type field. Alerts plugin conditions For Plugin conditions this is the metric, which has been defined in a plugin, that will be used to trigger a notification. Alerts conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_app_metric apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_kt_metric apdex error_percentage error_count response_time throughput browser_metric end_user_apdex total_page_load page_rendering web_application network dom_processing request_queuing ajax_response_time page_views_with_js_errors page_view_throughput ajax_throughput user_defined browser_metric_baseline page_view_throughput average_response_time ajax_response_time ajax_application_time mobile_metric database images json, network view_loading network_error_percentage status_error_percentage user_defined Alerts external service conditions The value specified in the type field controls which of the parameters may be specified. The type field and corresponding available parameter names are listed in the following table. Only one may be specified. type Parameter apm_external_service apdex error_percentage response_time_web response_time_background throughput_web throughput_background user_defined apm_app_metric_baseline external_service_transaction_time error_count database_transaction_time throughput_web response_time_web non_web_transaction_time web_transaction_database_time non_web_transaction_database_time mobile_external_service response_time_average response_time_minimum response_time_maximum throughput network_failure_percentage http_status_error_percentage metric_description This is a title for the metric which is displayed in notifications. Make this descriptive and unique so the reader will understand the nature of plugin metric being used to trigger an alert. Used for: Plugin conditions monitor_id This is the GUID of the Synthetic monitoring to alert on. Used for: Synthetic monitoring conditions name This condition title will allow to you identify it in the UI. Follow the guidelines for making this descriptive but short. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions nrql[query] This is the NRQL query that alerts monitors as part of a NRQL condition. Used for: NRQL conditions nrql[since_value] This is the timeframe (in minutes) in which to evaluate the specified NRQL query. since_value must be between 1 and 20. Used for: NRQL conditions open_violation_on_expiration When true, this opens a loss of signal violation when no signal within the expiration_duration time. The default is False. plugin[guid] This is the GUID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions plugin[id] This is the ID of the plugin for which the trigger is being defined. Used for: Plugin conditions runbook_url The runbook URL to display in notifications. This field is optional. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 2 minutes. Used with event flow and cadence aggregation methods. signal[aggregation_window] One of three data aggregation methods: event flow, event timer, and cadence. The default is Event flow. signal[aggregation_window] The amount of time before aggregated data is evaluated. Default is 1 minute. Used with Event timer aggregation method. signal[aggregation_window] The duration in which data is collected together before being evaluated. Default is 1 minute. terms[duration] This is the time (in minutes) for the condition to persist before triggering an event. It corresponds to the duration set when adding a threshold in the UI. Used for: Conditions terms[operator] This determines what comparison will be used between the value_function and the terms [ threshold] value to trigger an event. It corresponds to the operation selected when adding a threshold in the UI. It must be one of the following strings: above below equal Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[priority] This corresponds to the severity level selected when setting the threshold values for the condition in the UI. This must be one of the following strings: critical warning Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[threshold] This is the threshold that the value_function must be compared to using the terms [ operator] for an event to be triggered. It corresponds to the numeric value specified in the UI when adding the threshold values. This is a numeric value and must be 0 (zero) or greater. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions terms[time_function] This corresponds to the settings made in the UI when adding the threshold values. The choices are: all (corresponding to for at least in the UI) any (corresponding to at least once in in the UI) Used for: Conditions External service conditions Plugin conditions type This defines the type of metric that will be used for the alert. Allowable content for the metric field depends on the type value chosen. There are two product categories : Alerts conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of alerts condition. type Use apm_app_metric APM application metric will trigger an alert. apm_app_metric_baseline APM application metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). apm_kt_metric APM key transaction metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric Browser metric will trigger an alert. browser_metric_baseline Browser metric will trigger an alert (using a baseline threshold). mobile_metric Mobile metric will trigger an alert. Used for: Conditions Alerts external service conditions For this category, type is set to one of the following strings indicating the type of external service condition. type Use apm_external_service APM external metric will trigger an alert. mobile_external_service Mobile external metric will trigger an alert. Used for: External service conditions user_defined[metric] (optional) This is the name of a user defined custom metric to be used to determine if an event should be triggered. The user_defined [ value_function] associated with the metric is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. Used for: Conditions External service conditions Synthetic monitoring conditions Plugin conditions user_defined[value_function] (optional) This is the numeric value obtained from the custom metric specified by user_defined [ metric]. It is compared with the terms [ threshold] value when evaluating if an incident should be triggered. The comparison is performed using the operator defined by terms [ operator]. One of these value functions must be specified: average min max total sample_size Used for: Conditions value_function This is the value function used from the plugin metric. This may be one of the strings: min max average sample_size total percent Used for: Plugin conditions When used for a NRQL condition, the options are: single_value (condition is evaluated based on each query's returned value) sum (condition is evaluated based on the sum of each query's returned values over the specified duration) violation_time_limit_seconds Use to automatically close instance-based violations after the number of seconds specified. Must be one of these values: 3600 7200 14400 28800 43200 86400 Used for: Location conditions NRQL conditions violation_close_timer Use to automatically close instance-based violations, including JVM health metric violations, after the number of hours specified. Must be one of these values: 1 2 4 8 12 24 Used for: apm_app_metric (with condition_scope set to instance) apm_jvm_metric",

Logs in context adds metadata that links your logs with related APM data, like errors or distributed traces, or your platform performance data from infrastructure monitoring in New Relic One. See the root cause of issues across your platform By bringing all of your application and infrastructure data together in a single solution, you can get to the root cause of issues faster. Logs in context help you quickly see meaningful patterns and trends. The following diagram shows the lifecycle of a log message, from enrichment with agent metadata (contextual logging), to formatting and forwarding the log data to New Relic: This diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through New Relic. Don't spend extra time trying to narrow down all your logs from different parts of your platform. Instead, enable logs in context to see the exact log lines you need to identify and resolve a problem. Basic process to enable logs in context The process to enable logs in context is basically the same, regardless of which APM agent you use to monitor your application: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Update to a supported APM agent version for your app, and enable distributed tracing. Configure logs in context for your APM agent or for your infrastructure monitoring agent. View your logs within the context of your apps or infrastructure in New Relic One. The main differences in this procedure are which log appenders you can use to extend and enrich your log data, and how to configure the log appender you select for your APM agent. For detailed information, see the logs-in-context procedures for: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Infrastructure monitoring agent API and other options If our logging solutions don't meet your needs, you can use other options to send your log data to New Relic: Logging extensions via agent API calls HTTP endpoint via our Log API Syslog protocols via TCP endpoint (useful for CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services) What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI.

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

Sort Apdex to find the most dissatisfying. Specific web transaction: To view details about a specific transaction, select its row. By definition, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in this column is 100%. To focus on Apdex levels for specific transactions, you can also: Configure transaction traces to capture apdex_f, which is four times your app server's apdex_t. Create key transactions to track changes in Apdex values for specific transactions that are important to your business, such as signups, purchase confirmations, searches, site logins, etc. View Apdex score in browser Use browser monitoring to: Set Apdex levels for browser monitoring.

      "body": "Apdex is an industry standard to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. It's a simplified Service Level Agreement (SLA) solution that helps you see how satisfied users are with your app through metrics such as Apdex score and dissatisfaction percentage instead of easily skewed traditional metrics such as average response time. Apdex measurements Apdex is a measure of response time based against a set threshold. It measures the ratio of satisfactory response times to unsatisfactory response times. The response time is measured from an asset request to completed delivery back to the requestor. After you define a response time threshold T, all responses handled in T or less time satisfy the user. For example, if T is 1.2 seconds and a response completes in 0.5 seconds, then the user is satisfied. All responses greater than 1.2 seconds dissatisfy the user. Responses greater than 4.8 seconds frustrate the user. You can define multiple Apdex T values for each of these: Apdex measurements Comments APM apps APM monitors the performance of these apps. To define their Apdex settings, use the APM UI. You can find Apdex on the APM Summary page and the browser Summary page. Browser apps Browser monitors the end-user experience for these apps. To define end-user Apdex settings for these apps, use the browser UI. New Relic labels them as End user on the APM Overview page and the browser Overview page. Key transactions These are transactions important to your business that you choose to monitor. You can define Apdex settings for key transactions on the Key transactions page. Important The key transaction Apdex setting overrides the T value of that app. For details, see Key transaction Apdex. Apdex levels Apdex tracks three response counts: Satisfied: The response time is less than or equal to T. Tolerating: The response time is greater than T and less than or equal to 4T. In this example, 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 seconds is the maximum tolerable response time. Frustrated: The response time is greater than 4T or the request returns a server-side error. A high error rate can cause you to have a satisfying average response time, yet a poor Apdex score. Your configuration file's apdex_f value is four times your app server's Apdex T value. This threshold is useful, for example, with transaction traces. For more information, see the configuration file documentation for your New Relic agent. The time calculation will change based on your own app's T setting. In the following example, T = 1.2 seconds. Level Multiplier Time (T Example = 1.2) Satisfied T or less < = 1.2 seconds Tolerated > T, < = 4T Between 1.2 and 4.8 seconds Frustrated > 4T Greater than 4.8 seconds After you define your Apdex levels, use any of New Relic's resources to help identify and troubleshoot changes that indicate poor customer experiences with your app. Apdex score The Apdex score is a ratio value of the number of satisfied and tolerating requests to the total requests made. Each satisfied request counts as one request, while each tolerating request counts as half a satisfied request. An Apdex score varies from 0 to 1, with 0 as the worst possible score (100% of response times were Frustrated), and 1 as the best possible score (100% of response times were Satisfied). Example Apdex score: During a 2 minute period a host handles 200 requests. The Apdex threshold T = 0.5 seconds (500ms). This value is arbitrary and is selected by the user. 170 of the requests were handled within 500ms, so they are classified as Satisfied. 20 of the requests were handled between 500ms and 2 seconds (2000 ms), so they are classified as Tolerating. The remaining 10 were not handled properly or took longer than 2 seconds, so they are classified as Frustrated. The resulting Apdex score is 0.9: (170 + (20/2))/200 = 0.9. Important The formula used for calculating the Apdex score is designed for high-throughput apps. If your app's throughput is less than 100 RPM, not enough data is collected to determine a stable score. The instability may result in Apdex alert conditions behaving unexpectedly. Errors pages Any request that returns a server-side error such as 500: Application Error is a frustrating response, regardless of its return speed. You can use Apdex to visualize the impact of these errors, and then identify and resolve these errors with New Relic's built-in error analytics and error profile tools. Dissatisfaction percentage The dissatisfaction percentage is the percentage of the total dissatisfaction experienced by the app's users that is contributed by this transaction. Example Apdex dissatisfaction calculation: Frustrations(Transaction) + Tolerations(Transaction)/2 Frustrations(App) + Tolerations(App)/2 To visualize dissatisfaction percentage, you can sort your transactions by most dissatisfying. If a transaction is always frustratingly slow but rarely visited, it will not contribute much to the app's total dissatisfaction. Conversely, if a transaction is normally fast, but has high throughput, this may contribute a large proportion of the app's dissatisfaction simply because it contributes a large proportion of your app's traffic.",

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks Full-Stack Observability The collection of features and tools you can use to easily analyze and troubleshoot problems across your entire software stack. For more information, read our Introduction to Full-Stack Observability. harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. Telemetry Data Platform The collection of features and tools you can use to ingest, visualize, and alert on all your telemetry data in one place. For more information, read the Introduction to the Telemetry Data Platform. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our Full Stack Observability pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",
