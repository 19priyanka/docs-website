      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

API Explorer: Alerts Channels > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_channels.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy Update notification channels associated with policies You can associate a policy with one or more notification channels. You can also associate a notification channel with one or more policies. To add notification channels to policies, use your user key and these values in the API call: A policy_id value (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) One or more channel_id values in an array, separated by commas or a new line (available from API Explorer: Alerts Channels > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Policy Channels > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policy_channels.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -G -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID&channel_ids=channel_id' Copy Delete notification channels associated with policies You can associate a policy with one or more notification channels. You can also associate a notification channel with one or more alert policies. To remove a policy from a channel, or to remove a channel from a policy, use your user key and these values in the API call: The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The channel_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Channels > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Policy Channels > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policy_channels.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'channel_id=CHANNEL_ID&policy_id=POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for APM, browser, mobile These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list policy conditions. These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "A condition describes a monitored data source and the behavior of that data source that will be considered a violation. This document will explain the types of conditions available, how to create a condition, and how to view existing conditions. Related documentation: Basic concepts and workflow Min/max limits (like maximum number of conditions per policy) REST API to list or edit alert settings NRQL Condition NerdGraph API to manage your NRQL conditions via NerdGraph. Create a condition To create a condition: Create a policy and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition. OR From an existing policy page, select Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data-source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds Optional: After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. Important Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, 0.01 is the smallest possible value. Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or NerdGraph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Set up Incident Intelligence Before setting up Incident Intelligence, note that the count of incident events is a billing factor. To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Algorithmia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Algorithmia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Algorithmia for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or NerdGraph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

To view a summary of current alert violations, mouse over its health status indicator. If no, its health status indicator on the selected index will appear grey. Important To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see Introduction to important concepts. Exceptions The health status indicator doesn't apply for: Infrastructure entities Dashboards Entities targeted by labels Color-coded health status The index automatically appears when you select the product from the New Relic menu bar. For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?.

However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies/{id}.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Delete existing policies To delete an existing policy, use your user key, and include the policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) in the API call: API Explorer: Alerts Policies > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing policies To view a list of existing policies for your account, use your user key, and include these optional values in the API call: Optional policy name filter Optional pagination value API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy Notification channels These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list Alerts notification channels. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new notification channels To add new notification channels, use your user key and include these values in the API call: New channel's name Type of channel Configuration values The API Explorer shows the format for required configuration values for each type of notification channel.

API Explorer: Alerts Channels > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_channels.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy Update notification channels associated with policies You can associate a policy with one or more notification channels. You can also associate a notification channel with one or more policies. To add notification channels to policies, use your user key and these values in the API call: A policy_id value (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) One or more channel_id values in an array, separated by commas or a new line (available from API Explorer: Alerts Channels > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Policy Channels > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policy_channels.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -G -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID&channel_ids=channel_id' Copy Delete notification channels associated with policies You can associate a policy with one or more notification channels. You can also associate a notification channel with one or more alert policies. To remove a policy from a channel, or to remove a channel from a policy, use your user key and these values in the API call: The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The channel_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Channels > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Policy Channels > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policy_channels.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'channel_id=CHANNEL_ID&policy_id=POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for APM, browser, mobile These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list policy conditions. These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?.

However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives.

      "body": "A condition describes a monitored data source and the behavior of that data source that will be considered a violation. This document will explain the types of conditions available, how to create a condition, and how to view existing conditions. Related documentation: Basic concepts and workflow Min/max limits (like maximum number of conditions per policy) REST API to list or edit alert settings NRQL Condition NerdGraph API to manage your NRQL conditions via NerdGraph. Create a condition To create a condition: Create a policy and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition. OR From an existing policy page, select Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data-source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds Optional: After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. Important Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, 0.01 is the smallest possible value. Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or NerdGraph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

To remove a policy from a channel, or to remove a channel from a policy, use your user key and these values in the API call: The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The channel_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Channels > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Policy Channels > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policy_channels.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'channel_id=CHANNEL_ID&policy_id=POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for APM, browser, mobile These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list policy conditions. These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?.

However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\",

notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021, including the Incident Workflows beta. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey: \"example-route-key\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type config { key routeKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Webhook notification channel An example create mutation for a Webhook notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { baseUrl: \"https://example.com/webhook\", basicAuth: { password: \"t0t4lly-s3cr3t-p455w0rd\", username: \"webhook-user\" }, customHttpHeaders: [ {name: \"X-Api-Key\", value: \"100%-real-api-key\"}, {name:

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021, including the Incident Workflows beta. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey: \"example-route-key\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type config { key routeKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Webhook notification channel An example create mutation for a Webhook notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { baseUrl: \"https://example.com/webhook\", basicAuth: { password: \"t0t4lly-s3cr3t-p455w0rd\", username: \"webhook-user\" }, customHttpHeaders: [ {name: \"X-Api-Key\", value: \"100%-real-api-key\"}, {name:

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021, including the Incident Workflows beta. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create mutation for a Slack notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack notification channel name\", teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { key: \"example-api-key-from-victorops\", name: \"VictorOps notification channel name\", routeKey: \"example-route-key\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type config { key routeKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Webhook

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021, including the Incident Workflows beta. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails includeJson } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create an OpsGenie notification channel An example create mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { apiKey: \"api-key-from-opsgenie\", dataCenterRegion: US, name: \"OpsGenie notification channel name\", recipients: [\"user@example.com\"], tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"], teams: [\"team1\", \"team2\"] } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey teams tags recipients dataCenterRegion } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a PagerDuty notification channel An example create mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty notification channel name\", apiKey: \"api-key-from-pagerduty\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type config { apiKey } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a Slack notification channel An example create

teamChannel: \"#team-channel\", url: \"https://hooks.slack.com/services/FAKE/MOREFAKE/IMAGINARYEXAMPLEURLCHUNK\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type config { teamChannel url } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Create a VictorOps notification channel An example create mutation for a VictorOps notification channel: mutation {

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021, including the Incident Workflows beta. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. With incident workflow control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. Add a Workflow The Workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Tip The maximum workflows you can add per environment is 1000 Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entities.ids}} Note: the query name needs to be unique because you will use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 10. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notifier In order to save and activate a Workflow you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. Note: each notifier allows for extensive customization tailored to your needs. Examples can be found below Click “update message” once completing the notifier requirements, then complete the workflow by clicking activate. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You will see the names of the variables, that at runtime will be replaced with the variable’s value/s. In order to use the enrichers’ results use their name. Variables To get information about the entity that violated a condition, you can use variables as part of the where statement of the query. For example, to get a list of error logs for a specific issue use: FROM log SELECT * where service.name = {{ entities.names }} AND level = ‘error’ LIMIT 10 Copy This query returns the last 10 error logs for each notification sent for the entities that are associated with the issue. This would give you additional context as to what may have gone wrong and likely help you solve the issue faster. You can use any other entity properties in the same way. An example of how to populate the field Important Note: In order to attain the value in the JSON format, you must specify the word JSON. Otherwise, you will get a comma delimited list (e.g. {{ json entities.Ids}} ). For more variable options to find additional context, a comprehensive list of variables can be found here: Key Display Name (First word will be used for grouping) accumulations.origin Issue Origin accumulations.source Issue Source activatedAt Issue Activated At dataMLModules.components Machine Learning Components dataMLModules.suggestedResponders Machine Learning Suggested Responder dataMLModules.goldenSignals Machine Learning Golden Signals annotations.description Issue Description annotations.title Issue Title closedAt Issue ClosedAt createdAt Issue CreatedAt entities.ids Impacted Entities IDs entities.types Impacted Entities Types entities.names Impacted Entities Names entities.kinds Impacted Entities Kinds incidentIds Incident IDs isCorrelated Issue Is Correlated issueId Issue ID labels.accountIds Issue Environment Associated Account ID labels.aggregationKeys Labels Alerts Aggregation Key labels.conditionNames Labels Alert Condition Names labels.originalAccountIds Labels Account IDs labels.policyIds Labels Alert Policy IDs labels.policyNames Labels Alert Policy Names priority Issue Priority state Issue State status Issue Status totalIncidents Incident Count triggerEvent Issue Notification Trigger Event triggeredAt Issue Triggered At updatedAt Issue Updated At workflowName Workflow Name Destinations Destinations are unique identifiers and credentials for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications. Destinations are located under the Alerts and AI menu. Add a Destination Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Respond , then click Destinations. Select one of the destination types at the top of the destinations management screen. Webhook destination Use the webhook notifier to send notification messages to any endpoint. The webhook configuration requires: A unique destination name The endpoint url of the target application Authorization which can be ‘basic authentication or a ‘bearer token’ Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header. Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources To test your webhook, click ‘test connection’ on the bottom right. There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. ServiceNow incidents destination Using ServiceNow as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into new ServiceNow incidents. With two-way integrations, you can also make sure that status updates of ServiceNow incidents are mirrored back to New Relic. The ServiceNow notifier requires: Unique notifier name ServiceNow domain endpoint A username and password Optional: enable two-way integration Important The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional: enable two-way integration You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. Here are some important things to remember when configuring the two-way integration: The following steps are required to enable two-way integration: Check Allow two-way integration when you create the Notifier. Open and download this XML file(which includes the business rule for Incident Workflows). In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. We create a New Relic API-key in the SNOW ‘api_key_credentials’ table. If you want two-way integration, the user used for setting the destination also needs write permissions to the table: api_key_credentials After you enable two-way integration, an incident state in ServiceNow changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. Jira destination Using Jira as a notifier enables you to push valuable issues into a new Jira Cloud ticket. With two-way integration you can also make sure that state-updates are mirrored back to New Relic. Atlassian Jira notifiers need: Notifier name Jira url endpoint A username Jira API key After you enable two-way integration, an incident on Jira changes to Resolved or Closed, and the corresponding workflow incident changes to Closed. Finally, test your notifier to make sure everything is running smoothly and you are receiving your Alerts and Issues. If everything is connecting correctly, you will receive a ‘connection successful’ message.",

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "A condition describes a monitored data source and the behavior of that data source that will be considered a violation. This document will explain the types of conditions available, how to create a condition, and how to view existing conditions. Related documentation: Basic concepts and workflow Min/max limits (like maximum number of conditions per policy) REST API to list or edit alert settings NRQL Condition NerdGraph API to manage your NRQL conditions via NerdGraph. Create a condition To create a condition: Create a policy and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition. OR From an existing policy page, select Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data-source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds Optional: After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. Important Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, 0.01 is the smallest possible value. Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or NerdGraph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "A condition describes a monitored data source and the behavior of that data source that will be considered a violation. This document will explain the types of conditions available, how to create a condition, and how to view existing conditions. Related documentation: Basic concepts and workflow Min/max limits (like maximum number of conditions per policy) REST API to list or edit alert settings NRQL Condition NerdGraph API to manage your NRQL conditions via NerdGraph. Create a condition To create a condition: Create a policy and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition. OR From an existing policy page, select Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data-source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds Optional: After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. Important Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, 0.01 is the smallest possible value. Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or NerdGraph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

To remove a policy from a channel, or to remove a channel from a policy, use your user key and these values in the API call: The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The channel_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Channels > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Policy Channels > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policy_channels.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'channel_id=CHANNEL_ID&policy_id=POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for APM, browser, mobile These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list policy conditions. These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "A condition describes a monitored data source and the behavior of that data source that will be considered a violation. This document will explain the types of conditions available, how to create a condition, and how to view existing conditions. Related documentation: Basic concepts and workflow Min/max limits (like maximum number of conditions per policy) REST API to list or edit alert settings NRQL Condition NerdGraph API to manage your NRQL conditions via NerdGraph. Create a condition To create a condition: Create a policy and you will automatically be prompted to add a condition. OR From an existing policy page, select Create/add a condition. Follow the prompts in the UI, which include: Selecting a product/data-source Selecting a condition type Defining thresholds Optional: After you finish creating a condition, copy it and add it to other policies. Important Conditions that provide fields for you to input numerical values accept decimal points up to the second decimal place (hundredths). For example, 0.01 is the smallest possible value. Types of conditions Here are descriptions of the different types of conditions: NRQL query conditions Use the UI or NerdGraph API to create NRQL conditions for basic NRQL queries that return a number. APM metric alert conditions See APM metric alert conditions for tips about creating APM conditions using NRQL. Baseline conditions Baseline alerting allows you to create conditions that dynamically adjust to changing data and trends, such as weekly or seasonal patterns. This feature is available for APM and browser monitoring apps, as well as NRQL queries. Outlier detection conditions Outlier detection attempts to find groupings in your data and then looks for values that are outliers from those groupings. Outlier detection is available only for NRQL alerts. Synthetic monitoring multi-location conditions With multi-location Synthetic monitoring conditions, you can set up a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time. Key transaction metrics conditions For APM, you can set up conditions for key transactions. Java instance conditions You can set thresholds that open a violation when they are breached by any of your Java app's instance metrics. By scoping thresholds to specific instances, you can more quickly identify where potential problems are originating. This is useful, for example, to detect anomalies that are occurring only in a subset of your app's instances. These sorts of anomalies are easy to miss for apps that aggregate metrics across a large number of instances. JVM health metric conditions (Java apps) For Java apps monitored by APM, you can set thresholds that open a violation when the heap size or number of threads for a single JVM is out of the expected operating range. We calculate alerting threshold violations individually for each of the app's selected instances. When creating your condition, select JVM health metric as the type of condition for your Java app's alert policy, then select any of the available thresholds: Deadlocked threads Heap memory usage CPU utilization time Garbage collection CPU time Violations will automatically close when the inverse of the threshold is met, but by using the UI you can also change the time when a violation force-closes for a JVM health metric. Default is 24 hours. Web transaction percentile conditions We include the option to define a percentile as the threshold for your condition when your web app's response time is above, below, or equal to this value. This is useful, for example, when Operations personnel want to alert on a percentile for an app server's overall web transaction response time rather than the average web response time. Tip If you want to set an arbitrary threshold in a condition for a non-web app transaction, use the NRQL queries feature. To define the percentile threshold: Select Web transactions percentiles as the type of condition for your APM app's condition, then select a single app. (To alert on more than one app, create an individual Web transactions percentiles condition for each.) To define the thresholds that open the violation, type the Percentile nth response time value, then select its frequency (above, below, or equal to this value). We store the transaction time in milliseconds, although the user interface shows the Critical and Warning values as seconds. If you want to define milliseconds, be sure to include the decimal point in your value. Dynamic targeting with labels for apps By applying labels to applications, you can automatically link these entities to your condition. This makes it easy to manage all the applications within a dynamic environment. We recommend using the agent configuration file to best maintain entity labels. A single label identifies all entities associated with that label (maximum 10,000 entities). Multiple labels only identify entities which share all the selected labels. Using dynamic targeting with your condition also requires that you set a violation close timer. To add, edit, or remove up to ten labels for a condition: Select APM > Application metric as the product type. When identifying entities, select the Labels tab. Search for a label by name, or select a label from the list of categories. You can also create conditions directly within the context of what you are monitoring with Infrastructure. Infrastructure conditions You can create conditions for your resources directly in Infrastructure. For example, if you want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an Infrastructure agent, use the host not reporting condition type. This allows you to dynamically alert on filtered groups of hosts and configure the time window from 5 to 60 minutes. Apdex and response time conditions You can open violations and send notifications for response times. However, Apdex scores are almost always more meaningful and provide a better reflection of application performance. For example, average response times can be skewed by outliers, while the Apdex score gives a more accurate assessment of acceptable response time rates that your users experience. Change a condition name If you want to change the default condition name, make it short and descriptive. Provide useful information for notification messages that have limited characters, such as email subject lines, online chat, etc. Use camel case or dotted decimal notation. Describe the essence of what is being violated. To change an existing condition's name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click a condition name to edit it, and then type a meaningful name for the condition. You can't edit the product and condition type associated with a condition. Instead, you must delete the condition and create a new one with a different product and condition type. Maintain policies and conditions After you save the condition, the currently selected policy lists all alert conditions that apply to it. From here you can: Repeat the steps to add more conditions to the policy. Continue the policy setup process by adding one or more notification channels to it. Change the condition's name, the entities it's scoped to, or the critical (red) and warning (yellow) thresholds. Copy the condition and add it other policies in the selected account. Rename the policy. Disable any conditions in the policy, or delete the policy or any of its conditions. You may also manage your policies via the policies NerdGraph API. View existing conditions The policies index lists them in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing conditions: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list, then select a policy's name to see its conditions. To view policy and condition information for a specific entity: From that entity's product UI, select Settings, then click Alert conditions.",

For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations.

For more about the definition of violations and other terms, see Alerts concepts. What is a violation event? The violation of a condition generates a violation event. This event has various attributes (metadata) attached to it and different attributes can be used by different features. Important The violation event is a concept used to determine alerting features. While you can query some of its associated attributes via NerdGraph, you cannot directly query the violation event. Violation event attributes This table shows violation event attributes. The violation event data type is collected in NrAiIncident. BETA FEATURE NrAiIncident is still in development, so may be subject to unannounced changes, but we encourage you to try it out! You may be wondering why we're using NrAiIncident as the name for the violation event data type. Although we currently refer to these events as \"violations,\" they'll be called \"incidents\" in our new, upcoming naming scheme. This name prepares for and reflects our future intentions.

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "With alerts you can easily tell whether an entity (the target for the notification) has one or more conditions associated with it: If yes, its health status indicator on the selected index (APM, browser, etc.) will be color-coded to the current state. To view a summary of current alert violations, mouse over its health status indicator. If no, its health status indicator on the selected index will appear grey. Important To learn more about how conditions and policies work together, see Introduction to important concepts. Exceptions The health status indicator doesn't apply for: Infrastructure entities Dashboards Entities targeted by labels Color-coded health status The index automatically appears when you select the product from the New Relic menu bar. For example, to view the index of APM apps, go to one.newrelic.com, then click APM. The Applications index lists all APM product entities and their current health status. Color Health status Green The entity is operational. We are collecting data that you can view in the appropriate UI. No alert violations are currently reported for it. Yellow The entity is degraded. A warning threshold has been violated. Red A critical threshold has been violated: Notifications have been sent based on the selected incident rollup preference. The incident appears in the Incidents index. Gray The entity's status is unknown. We're not receiving alerts data for the entity. This could mean alerts are muted, not set up, or the reporting system is down. Health status transitions The following table describes the different health status transitions an entity can endure: From... To... Transition explanation Gray Green The entity is evaluated for at least one condition, and the results show there are no violations present. Green / Red Gray Possible explanations: The last condition associated to the entity has been deleted and therefore there's no status to report. The last condition associated to the entity has been disabled and therefore there's no status to report. The entity has stopped reporting data. There's a New Relic platform issue. Check the New Relic status page for updates. Green Yellow / Red There's at least one open violation at the time the entity is undergoing the evaluation. Yellow / Red Green The last open violation associated to the entity has been closed. Example: App without conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is not associated with any conditions. Its color-coded health status is light grey, which indicates no alert conditions are set up for that entity. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that currently isn't associated with any alerts conditions. Its grey status icon means it doesn't have any conditions. Follow standard procedures to add it to an existing condition or to create a new condition for it. Example: App with conditions Here's an example of an app listed on the APM index that is associated with one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status is green, because we are collecting data for it, and currently there are no Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Explorer: This example shows an app that has one or more conditions. Its color-coded health status (green) shows the app hasn't reached any threshold violations. Tip To view the index listing currently open incidents across all products, not just this entity, select View all violations.",

For more about the definition of violations and other terms, see Alerts concepts. What is a violation event? The violation of a condition generates a violation event. This event has various attributes (metadata) attached to it and different attributes can be used by different features. Important The violation event is a concept used to determine alerting features. While you can query some of its associated attributes via NerdGraph, you cannot directly query the violation event. Violation event attributes This table shows violation event attributes. The violation event data type is collected in NrAiIncident. BETA FEATURE NrAiIncident is still in development, so may be subject to unannounced changes, but we encourage you to try it out! You may be wondering why we're using NrAiIncident as the name for the violation event data type. Although we currently refer to these events as \"violations,\" they'll be called \"incidents\" in our new, upcoming naming scheme. This name prepares for and reflects our future intentions. All attributes are available for use in a description. Read about attributes available for muting rules. Attribute Description accountId The ID of the account where the violation occurred. Available for muting rules. aggregationDuration The active condition's aggregation window. closeCause If applicable, what caused the incident to close.

Available values: Threshold (the condition threshold was breached) Expiration (the entity's signal was lost) event The record's event type. Available values: Open and Close. expirationDuration The active condition's signal loss time window. incidentID The unique identifier of the violation. muted Shows whether the active condition was muted at the time of the violation event. mutingRuleID The unqiue identifier of the muting rule that caused the violation to be muted. nrqlEventType The type of data targeted by a NRQL condition. In this context, this refers to any NRQL-queryable data type. Available for muting rules. nrqlQuery The full string of the NRQL query. Can be used for sub-string matching on attributes in the WHERE clause. Available for muting rules. openTime The timestamp when the violation was opened. operator The violation threshold's operator, such as =, <, or >.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Set up Incident Intelligence Before setting up Incident Intelligence, note that the count of incident events is a billing factor. To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Algorithmia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Algorithmia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Algorithmia for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "Configuring incident detection consistently across your entire estate helps you track the overall health of your systems, avoid blindspots, and reduce the time it takes to identify and resolve issues. We know that creating accurate alert conditions is anything but simple. Knowing which metrics to monitor, and setting the thresholds accordingly, is a task that few have the necessary knowledge of both their systems and of New Relic to feel confident executing. This results in teams only applying incident detection practices to a subset of critical services. Good news: New Relic One now has an alert condition recommendation service that uses AI and machine learning (ML) to recommend specific metrics and signals to monitor for your specific entities. You can use the provided recommendations or modify them to fit your specific needs. Here’s how you can add recommended alerts to APM entities that do not currently have alert coverage. Using recommended conditions Go to Services - APM in New Relic Navigator and you’ll see a high-density view of the health of your system. With the traffic-light visual, it’s easy to view which entities are healthy, which entities have violations, and which entities do not have any alerts coverage. If an entity does not have alert coverage, its hexagon will be gray. Recommended conditions helps you automatically add alerts to entities that do not have alerts coverage, those gray hexagons. Select an entity: Click an uncovered entity (gray hexagon). A new option will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Click Create alert condition as shown in the image below. Choose a number of recommended conditions. The recommendations will depend on the quality of the tags associated with an entity. The more accurate and informative the tags are, the more precise the recommendations will be. The image below shows a few possible recommendations based on error percentage, Apdex, and response time.

Read on to learn the best practices for: Policies Notification channels Incident preferences Thresholds and violations Muting rules Recommended alerts Use recommended alerts conditions conditions if you are new to Alerts or if you want suggestions that optimize your alert coverage. Organize your policies A policy is a container for similar conditions. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to create, edit, or find policies. Organize your policy's scope to a single entity when possible. Assign your policy to the essential team or teams that need to be notified when an incident occurs. This way, you keep policies centralized and focused. If a team is monitoring several groups of the same entity type, combine those entity clusters (like servers) together into one policy. This way, your team can be notified from one policy rather than navigating several policies at once. You can use Alerts to monitor all of your entities. Consider your role and priorities when assigning yourself to a policy. For example: Software developers may need notifications for both front-end and back-end performance, such as webpage response time and page load JavaScript errors. Operations personnel may need notifications for poor back-end performance, such as server memory and load averages. The product owner may need notifications for positive front-end performance, such as improved end user Apdex scores or sales being monitored in dashboards. Set your condition thresholds and violations Set meaningful threshold levels to optimize Alerts for your business. Here are some suggested guidelines: Action Recommendations Set threshold levels Avoid setting thresholds too low. For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives. Experimenting with settings You do not need to edit files or restart software, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary. Adjust settings Adjust your conditions over time. As you use our products to help you optimize your entity's performance, tighten your thresholds to keep pace with your improved performance. If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this. Disable settings You can disable any condition in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds. In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded health status indicator in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There are two violation thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the suggestions above. Important Warning violations do not open incidents. A critical violation can open incidents, but you must define that decision through your incident preferences. Decide what happens when there's no signal Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. You can configure loss of signal settings by condition in the UI or configure loss of signal via the NerdGraph API. Use non-null values when there's no signal By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or configure gap filling values via NerdGraph Define your incident preferences Decide when you get incident notifications so you can respond to incidents when they happen. If you’re new to Alerts, learn more about your incident preferences options. The default incident preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one incident. Change your default incident preference setting to increase or decrease the number of incidents and incident notifications you receive. Each team within your organization will have different needs. Ask your team two important questions when deciding your incident preferences: Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong? Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once? When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope (like managing the performance of several entities), increase the amount of incidents you receive. You will need more notifications because two incidents will not necessarily relate to each other. When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like managing the performance of one entity), opt for the default incident preference. You will need less notifications when two incidents are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem. Decide how you get incident notifications by using our notification channel best practices. Select your notification channels Tailor notifications to the most useful channel and policy so you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to set up notification channels. Notify teams and individuals who needs to stay updated on or resolve a problem when an incident arises. To stay updated, select a notification channel that is less intrusive, like email. For vital notifications and incident responses, select a notification channel that is more intrusive, like PagerDuty or Slack. Do not rely on email for quick notifications in case of delays. Understand muting rules Mute alerts during routine events, such as maintenance or planned downtime. You can also silence a policy, a specific entity, and a condition when needed. Incidents can still be opened, but you won't be notified. If you're new to Alerts, learn how to create and manage muting rules. What's next? To learn more about using alerts: Learn about the API.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data.

We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?.

However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Set up Incident Intelligence Before setting up Incident Intelligence, note that the count of incident events is a billing factor. To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Algorithmia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Algorithmia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Algorithmia for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Set up Incident Intelligence Before setting up Incident Intelligence, note that the count of incident events is a billing factor. To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Algorithmia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Algorithmia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Algorithmia for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "The streaming alerts platform checks for violations based on data that’s present or missing in your stream of data, or signal, coming into New Relic. You can use NRQL conditions to control what part of the signal you want to be notified about. Your NRQL condition filters the data that's processed by the streaming algorithm. There are three methods for aggregating the data filtered through your NRQL condition: Event flow (default) Event timer Cadence Why it matters Understanding how streaming alerts works will help you fine-tune your NRQL conditions to be notified about what's important to you. Only data that matches the conditions of the NRQL WHERE clause is alerted on. For more details on each step of the process, see Streaming alerts process and descriptions. As data streams into New Relic, it's filtered by the NRQL condition. Before data is evaluated, it must meet the criteria defined by the NRQL query's WHERE clause. Instead of evaluating that data immediately for violations, the NRQL alert conditions collect the data over a period of time known as the aggregation window. An additional delay/timer allows for slower data points to arrive before the window is aggregated. Once the delay/timer time has elapsed, New Relic aggregates the data into a single data point. Alerts then evaluates the data point using the NRQL condition in order to determine whether it meets the violation threshold criteria. Even if a data point meets the criteria for a violation, a violation may not be triggered. A violation is only triggered when data points consistently meet the threshold criteria over a period of time. This is the threshold duration. If the data points are in violation for an entire threshold duration, we'll send you a notification based on your policy settings. All of these configurable delays give you more control over how you're alerted on sporadic and missing data. Streaming alerts process and descriptions Process Description Streaming data All data coming into New Relic. WHERE clause Filters all incoming streaming data. We only monitor for alerts on data that makes it through this filter. Aggregation methods One of three methods that control how data is collected before it's evaluated. They are: Event flow (Default) Event timer Cadence Aggregation window Data with timestamps that fall within this window will be aggregated and then evaluated. Delay/timer A time delay to ensure all data points have arrived in the aggregation window before aggregation occurs. Aggregated data Data in the aggregated window is collapsed to a single data point for alert evaluation. Evaluation The data point is evaluated by the NRQL condition, which is trigged by each incoming aggregated data point. Threshold duration A specific duration that determines if a violation is created. If your specified NRQL condition meets the threshold criteria over the threshold duration, a violation occurs. When a data point lacks data, a custom value is inserted to fill the gap. Choose your aggregation method You can choose between three different aggregation methods, depending on your needs. Event flow (default) works best for data that comes in frequently and mostly in order. Event timer works best for data that arrives infrequently in batches, such as cloud integration data or infrequent error logs. Cadence is our original and inferior aggregation method. It aggregates data on specific time intervals as detected by New Relic's internal wall clock, regardless of data timestamps. Event flow detail Event flow starts aggregating data when the first data point arrives in a subsequent window. The custom delay defines which subsequent window data will start to populate to trigger aggregation of the current window. A custom delay provides extra time for data to arrive. These times are based on the data's timestamps and not New Relic's wall clock time. For example, suppose you're monitoring CPU usage in window durations of 1 minute and a 3 minute delay. When a CPU usage data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, event flow will not aggregate that window until a data point shows up with a timestamp between 12:04pm and 12:05pm. When event flow receives the first data point with a timestamp of 12:04pm or later, it sends the 12:00 to 12:01 data to be aggregated. Event timer detail Like event flow, event timer only starts aggregating data when data arrives. When a data point arrives, a timer starts to count down. If no data arrives before the timer counts down, the data is evaluated. When a data point arrives before the timer has completed counting down, the timer is reset. For example, suppose you're monitoring CloudWatch data that arrives fairly infrequently. You're using a window duration of 1 minute and a 3 minute timer. When a CloudWatch data point comes in with a timestamp between 12:00pm and 12:01pm, the timer will start to count down. If no further data points show up for that 12:00-12:01 window, the window will get aggregated 3 minutes later. If a new data point with a timestamp between 12:00 and 12:01 arrives, the timer resets. It keeps resetting every time more data points for that window arrive. The window will not be sent for aggregation until the timer reaches 0. If the timer for a later data point elapses before an earlier data point, the event timer method waits for the earlier timer to elapse before aggregating the later data point. For best results, make sure your timer is equal to or longer than your window duration time. If the timer is less than your window duration and your data flow is inconsistent, then your data may be evaluated before all of your data points arrive. This could cause you to be notified incorrectly. Cadence We recommend you use one of the other two methods. Cadence is our old streaming aggregation method. This method uses New Relic's wall clock time to determine when data is aggregated and evaluated. It doesn't take into account data point timestamps as they arrive. Streaming alerts tools Streaming alerts provide a set of tools to give you greater control over how your data is aggregated before it's evaluated to reduce incorrect notifications you receive. They are: Window duration Delay/timer Loss of signal detection Gap filling Tip This article covers these tools at a conceptual level. You'll find direct instructions on how to use these tools in Create NRQL alert conditions. Window duration In order to make loss of signal detection more effective and to reduce unnecessary notifications, you can customize aggregation windows to the duration that you need. An aggregation window is a specific block of time. We gather data points together in an aggregation window, before evaluating the data. A longer aggregation window can smooth out the data, since an outlier data point will have more data points to be aggregated with, giving it less of an influence on the aggregated data point that is sent for evaluation. When a data point arrives, its timestamp is used to put it in the proper aggregation window. You can set your aggregation window to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is 1 minute. Delay/timer The delay/timer setting controls how long the condition should wait before aggregating the data in the aggregation window. The event flow and cadence methods use delay. Event timer uses timer. The delay default is 2 minutes. The timer default is 1 minute and has a minimum value of 5 seconds. Loss of signal detection Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. A loss of signal is caused by different things. The WHERE clause in your NRQL query can filter out data before it's evaluated for violations. It could also mean a service or entity is offline or a periodic job has failed to run and no data is being sent to New Relic. In order to avoid unnecessary notifications, you can choose how long to wait before you're notified by a loss of signal violation. You can use loss of signal detection to open violations and be notified when a signal is lost. Alternately, you can use a loss of signal to close violations for ephemeral services or sporadic data, such as error counts. Gap filling Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with the last value received, a static value, or else do nothing and leave the gap there. The default is None. Gaps in streaming data can be caused by network or host issues, a signal may be sparse, or some signals, such as error counts, may only have data when something is wrong. By filling the gaps with known values, the alert evaluation process can process those gaps and determine how they should affect the loss of signal evaluation. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss and gap filling, see this Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for Synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

To remove a policy from a channel, or to remove a channel from a policy, use your user key and these values in the API call: The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The channel_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Channels > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Policy Channels > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policy_channels.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'channel_id=CHANNEL_ID&policy_id=POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for APM, browser, mobile These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list policy conditions. These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition. You can also view the condition id from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List. Update conditions for policies To update conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete conditions from policies To delete conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your policy, use your REST API key or user key, and the associated policy_id in the API call. API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > GET > List curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'policy_id=$POLICY_ID' Copy Conditions for NRQL These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, update, delete, or list NRQL conditions for your policies. Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI. To update NRQL conditions for policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > PUT > Update curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" } } }' Copy Delete NRQL conditions for policies To delete NRQL conditions from policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The condition's id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > GET > List) API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > DELETE > Delete curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/$CONDITION_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy List existing NRQL conditions for policies To view a list of existing conditions for your alert policy, use your user key or REST API key, and the associated policy_id in the API call.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Set up Incident Intelligence Before setting up Incident Intelligence, note that the count of incident events is a billing factor. To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Algorithmia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Algorithmia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Algorithmia for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including suggested responders for PagerDuty sources in October 2021. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

Exception: NRQL baseline conditions are not available from this endpoint. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is streamed, set the aggregation_method to EVENT_FLOW and use the default settings of 1 for aggregation_window and 2 for aggregation_delay. EVENT_FLOW works in most use-cases, but for a discussion on which use cases work better with EVENT_TIMER, see Which aggregation method to use?. API Explorer: Alerts Nrql Conditions > POST > Create To create NRQL conditions for policies: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_nrql_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"nrql_condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"value_function\": \"string\", \"nrql\": { \"query\": \"string\", \"since_value\": \"string\" }, \"signal\": { \"aggregation_window\": \"string\", \"evaluation_offset\": \"string\", \"fill_option\": \"string\", \"fill_value\": \"string\" }, \"expiration\": { \"expiration_duration\": \"string\", \"open_violation_on_expiration\": boolean, \"close_violations_on_expiration\": boolean } } }' Copy If you set nrql[since_value] to 3 and nrql[query] to SELECT count FROM myEvent, New Relic evaluates the following query against the terms[threshold] value once per minute: SELECT count FROM myEvent SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago Copy If you set type as outlier, you can omit the value_function. However, two additional fields are required: expected_groups and ignore_overlap. For more information, see Alerts Conditions API field names. If you omit type or set it as static, it will default to standard NRQL alerting. Update NRQL conditions for policies Recommendation: Due to the way NRQL data is aggregated, set the nrql[since_value] to 3 or higher to prevent false positives. This allows three minutes to aggregate data, and equates to the Evaluation Offset value in the Alerts Condition UI.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier condition types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL conditions produce a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL conditions, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation duration window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple aggregation functions Each condition can only target a single aggregated value. To alert on multiple values simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline condition types. The outlier condition type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query based on the aggregation window duration, percentiles will be calculated for each duration separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy NRQL conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window duration is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remaining events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period NRQL conditions evaluate data based on how it's aggregated, using aggregation windows from 30 seconds to 15 minutes, in increments of 15 seconds. For best results, we recommend using the event flow or event timer aggregation methods. For the cadence aggregation method, the implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your delay/timer setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window duration, the delay/timer, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert condition types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of conditions: NRQL alert condition types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL condition. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, including the optional FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) condition types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. Note that when you have a faceted query, each facet is a signal. So if any one of those signals ends during the duration specified, that will be considered a loss of signal. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, use the advanced signal settings to control streaming alert data and avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window duration Delay/timer Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window duration You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between 30 seconds and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Delay/timer You can adjust the delay/timer to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's behavior. If your data is sparse or inconsistent, you may want to use the event timer aggregation method. For the cadence method, the total supported latency is the sum of the aggregation window duration and the delay. If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using the event flow method with the default settings. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you use the event timer method. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post. Options for editing data gap settings: In the NRQL conditions UI, go to Condition settings > Advanced signal settings > fill data gaps with and choose an option. If using our Nerdgraph API (preferred), this node is located at: actor : account : alerts : nrqlCondition : signal : fillOption | fillValue NerdGraph is our recommended API for this but if you're using our REST API, you can find this setting in the REST API explorer under the \"signal\" section of the Alert NRQL conditions API.",

      "body": "You can manage alerts conditions using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some conditions queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. This document covers the following: Steps to create a NRQL condition NRQL static condition NRQL baseline condition NRQL outlier condition Update a condition Update mutations List and filter NRQL conditions Singular NRQL condition queries Create a description Delete conditions Steps to create a NRQL condition Follow these steps: Decide which condition type you want to create (see NRQL Condition threshold types). Find your relevant policyID by doing one of the following: Use the NerdGraph policies API. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Choose a policy. Find the ID under the policy name. Provide the appropriate mutation for your NRQL condition type and the relevant values. Tip The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer is the best place to find up-to-date documentation about the per-field specifics of the NerdGraph NRQL Conditions API. For example, questions like \"What does the valueFunction field accept?\" are best answered with the inline NerdGraph documentation. NRQL static condition Here's an example of creating a static condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Low Host Count - Catastrophic\" enabled: true nrql: { query: \"SELECT uniqueCount(host) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='my-app-name'\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW aggregationDelay: 120 } terms: { threshold: 2 thresholdOccurrences: AT_LEAST_ONCE thresholdDuration: 600 operator: BELOW priority: CRITICAL } valueFunction: SINGLE_VALUE violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name } } Copy NRQL baseline condition Here's an example of creating a baseline condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" enabled: true baselineDirection: UPPER_ONLY nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW aggregationDelay: 120 } terms: { threshold: 13 thresholdDuration: 180 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy NRQL outlier condition Here's an example of creating an outlier condition: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionOutlierCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID, condition: { name: \"Outlier Condition\" enabled: true expectedGroups: 4 openViolationOnGroupOverlap: false nrql: { query: \"SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction FACET httpResponseCode\" } signal: { aggregationWindow: 60 aggregationMethod: EVENT_FLOW aggregationDelay: 120 } terms: { threshold: 1 thresholdDuration: 300 thresholdOccurrences: ALL operator: ABOVE priority: CRITICAL } violationTimeLimitSeconds: 86400 }) { id name expectedGroups openViolationOnGroupOverlap } } Copy Update a condition Complete the following: Determine the type of your existing condition by requesting the type field in a nrqlConditionsSearch query like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id type } } } } } } Copy Tip The type returned is what you use for your update mutation. For example, if the type returned is STATIC, use alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate. If the type returned is BASELINE, use alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate. If the type returned is OUTLIER, use alertsNrqlConditionOutlierUpdate. Provide the id of your condition to your relevant condition type mutation. Note that you can only update conditions of the relevant type. Only provide update mutations for the fields you want to update. Fields you don't provide in the update are not touched. Update mutations Only fields that you provide in the update are changed. In the following example, baselineDirection returns unchanged, but name is updated. mutation { alertsNrqlConditionBaselineUpdate(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID, accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, condition: { name: \"Your updated name\" }) { id name baselineDirection } } Copy List and filter NRQL conditions To list or filter your NRQL conditions, use the nrqlConditionsSearch query in NerdGraph. Use cursor pagination The basic of list functionality for NRQL conditions allows you to paginate through your NRQL conditions as well as request the total count of conditions per account. The nrqlConditionsSearch query utilizes cursor pagination to paginate through resources. The idea behind cursor pagination is that the client will request a cursor in a programmatic loop until the cursor comes back empty. An initial list response will look something like this: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy This example returns a JSON response like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nextCursor\": \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"id\": \"4432\", \"name\": \"Baseline Condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"443\", \"name\": \"A static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\" }, // more conditions here in reality ], \"totalCount\": 435 } } } } } } Copy In order to paginate through conditions in the response, have the client request the cursor to be returned until the nextCursor returns from the response as null: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(cursor: \"WOwfJ4+TWm9QTFeKMGyg+w==:QqkI8S4+Wwnpno6z+uk8kQ==\", ) { nextCursor nrqlConditions { id name type } totalCount } } } } } Copy Request type-specific fields Certain fields are only available on specific NRQL condition types. The main reason that mutations are split between the different condition types is because they have minor differences between the fields they accept. For example, valueFunction is only relevant for static NRQL conditions and baselineDirection is only relevant on baseline NRQL conditions. But if these fields are only available on these certain condition types, how do we return them in a list of all of our condition types? The answer is a GraphQL convention known as inline fragments. Inline fragments allow you to access the data on a specific type of NRQL condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch { nrqlConditions { id name type ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } ...on AlertsNrqlBaselineCondition { baselineDirection } ...on AlertsNrqlOutlierCondition { expectedGroups } } } } } } } Copy In the previous example query, we are asking GraphQL to do the hard work for us to determine which NRQL conditions are the correct type. So, when the returned type is a static condition, it will return the valueFunction in the object. When the returned type is a baseline condition, it will return baselineDirection instead, and when the type is an outlier condition, it will return expectedGroups. Here is an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"nrqlConditionsSearch\": { \"nrqlConditions\": [ { \"baselineDirection\": \"UPPER_ONLY\", \"id\": \"342\", \"name\": \"My baseline condition\", \"type\": \"BASELINE\" }, { \"id\": \"553\", \"name\": \"My static condition\", \"type\": \"STATIC\", \"valueFunction\": \"SINGLE_VALUE\" }, { \"expectedGroups\": 4, \"id\": \"802\", \"name\": \"My outlier condition\", \"type\": \"OUTLIER\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Filter NRQL conditions You can filter NRQL conditions with the searchCriteria argument of the nrqlConditionsSearch query: Here's an example of filtering NRQL conditions with matching by name. This query returns NRQL conditions that match the provided name. Note that this match is case insensitive. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditionsSearch(searchCriteria: { name: \"Baseline Condition\" }) { nrqlConditions { id name type } } } } } } Copy Singular NRQL condition queries You can use the NRQL condition API to query for a singular condition. Run the nrqlCondition query in the alerts namespace. Similar to type specific fields on the nrqlConditionSearch query, you can also use these inline fragments to request fields that are restricted to a NRQL condition type. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id name ...on AlertsNrqlStaticCondition { valueFunction } } } } } } Copy Update the description This will walk you through the procedure to create a description for a NRQL alert condition. Get all the conditions for a policy: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlConditions(policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID) { nextCursor results { id name description enabled nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow aggregationMethod aggregationDelay aggregationTimer } policyId runbookUrl terms { duration operator priority timeFunction threshold } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } } Copy Get the details for a single condition: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { nrqlCondition(id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\") { description id enabled name nrql { query } signal { aggregationWindow aggregationMethod aggregationDelay aggregationTimer } policyId runbookUrl terms { operator priority threshold thresholdDuration thresholdOccurrences } type violationTimeLimitSeconds } } } } } Copy Create a mutation with the description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { description } } Copy Here's an example mutation with an included example description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: { description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"} ) { description } } Copy Delete conditions You can use the alertsConditionDelete mutation to delete any type of condition. You can only request the id field on a delete mutation; for example: mutation { alertsConditionDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CONDITION_ID) { id } } Copy",

Headerless HTTP ingest Added support for headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key). This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More data, more power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. For more information, see our documentation about finding data in long logs (blobs) and the Log Event API. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on Add Your Data page. Notes In partnership with our customers, the New Relic log team has been rapidly innovating our log management capabilities since the initial release in 2019. Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business.

      "body": "The New Relic Insights query API is a REST API for making NRQL queries. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Requirements and recommendations This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Use of this API may be restricted by role-related user permissions. To add custom data to New Relic, you'd use our data ingest APIs. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. 1. Register an API key To use the Insights query API, you need a query key. You can have multiple query keys, and any query key can be used to initiate any Insights API query. If you have multiple systems querying Insights or different data destinations, New Relic recommends you use multiple query keys to enhance data security. For security reasons, query keys cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a query key, use the New Relic UI. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. To create a new query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Select the plus icon next to the Query keys heading. Enter a short description of the key. Select Save your notes. 2. Create the API query request When you create or edit a query key, you will see an example curl query that you can use as a template. The example query won't work unless you follow these query rules: The NRQL query string must be URL-encoded. The query string must be less than 4000 bytes. The URL must contain a valid account ID. The X-Query-Key must contain a valid query key. The Content-Type must be application/json. Linux Here is a curl example: curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY\" Copy Microsoft Windows You can use Powershell to query events via API: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY -Headers @{\"X-Query-Key\"=\"YOUR_QUERY_KEY\"} -ContentType \"application/json\" -Method GET Copy 3. Process the returned JSON The query API returns results in JSON format. There is a limit of 2,000 results per request. The structure of the JSON data depends on the NRQL that you used in the request: Different combinations of SELECT statements, clauses, and functions each return an appropriate response. When writing your code to process the JSON, you should do a test run of your query and examine the resulting JSON. Example The Insights query API returns JSON data. Here's an example of a query, its query request format, and its returned data: Query, query API request, returned data Original NRQL query: SELECT count(appName) FROM PageView SINCE '2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500' Copy Query cURL request (with URL-encoded NRQL query): curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=SELECT+count%28appName%29+FROM+PageView+SINCE+%272014-08-04+00%3A00%3A00%2B0500%27\" Copy Returned JSON data: { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 80275388 } ], \"metadata\": { \"eventTypes\": [ \"PageView\" ], \"eventType\": \"PageView\", \"openEnded\": true, \"beginTime\": \"2014-08-03T19:00:00Z\", \"endTime\": \"2017-01-18T23:18:41Z\", \"beginTimeMillis=\": 1407092400000, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"rawSince\": \"'2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500'\", \"rawUntil\": \"`now`\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"clippedTimeWindows\": { \"Browser\": { \"beginTimeMillis\": 1483571921198, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"retentionMillis\": 1209600000 } }, \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"count\", \"attribute\": \"appName\", \"simple\": true } ] } } Copy Rate limiting guidelines We have query rate limits. You likely won't encounter these limits, especially if you follow these general guidelines: Limit the amount of requests with complex queries (for example, queries with FACET or TIMESERIES clauses, or queries of over a million events) run at the same time. Limit the amount of requests run concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of 5, especially if they include complex queries. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for the number of queries per minute, the query API returns a 429 error. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for records inspected, the query API returns a 503 error and your charts may display timeout error messages.",

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "Do not use the Insights Dashboards API. Instead, use the New Relic One Dashboards API with NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. End of life notice The Insights Dashboard API reaches end of life in 2021. As of July 28, 2021, the CREATE and UPDATE endpoints are not available. As of August 30, 2021, the GET and DELETE endpoints are not available. To make the transition from the Insights Dashboard API to the New Relic One Dashboards API, see our migration guide. For more information, see the NerdGraph dashboards tutorial and Explorers Hub post. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). If the name begins with anything other than an alphabetical character, enclose the name with backticks in your NRQL query. For example: FROM `0_hello` SELECT count(*) Copy Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic integrations Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: *EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) *CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. *EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation_timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing plan. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integrations. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, as well as the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. For New Relic organizations on our original pricing plan, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). See Integrations. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing plan, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. Plugins Plugins provides an open platform to monitor critical information about your entire stack. New Relic partners, PaAS and SaAS providers, third-party vendors, and plugin users can: Quickly install and use publicly available plugins in Plugin Central. Develop your own plugin agents to collect the metric data that matters most to your business. Publish your plugins for public or private access. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

For more information, try out NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API explorer, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Also see our NerdGraph parsing rules tutorial and drop data tutorial. Headerless HTTP ingest Added support for headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key). This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More data, more power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. For more information, see our documentation about finding data in long logs (blobs) and the Log Event API. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on Add Your Data page. Notes In partnership with our customers, the New Relic log team has been rapidly innovating our log management capabilities since the initial release in 2019. Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business.

For more information, try out NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API explorer, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Also see our NerdGraph parsing rules tutorial and drop data tutorial. Headerless HTTP ingest Added support for headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key). This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More data, more power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. For more information, see our documentation about finding data in long logs (blobs) and the Log Event API. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on Add Your Data page. Notes In partnership with our customers, the New Relic log team has been rapidly innovating our log management capabilities since the initial release in 2019. Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business. To stay up to date the most recent fixes and enhancements, subscribe to our Logs RSS feed. More to come soon!",

      "body": "Parsing is the process of splitting unstructured log data into attributes (key/value pairs). You can use these attributes to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. To get started with parsing, you may want to watch the following video tutorial on YouTube (approx. 4-1/2 minutes). New Relic parses log data according to rules. This document describes how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. You can also create, query, and manage your log parsing rules by using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For more information, see our NerdGraph tutorial for parsing. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule is created with matching criteria that determines which logs the rule will attempt to parse. To simplify the matching process, we recommend adding a logtype attribute to your logs. However, you are not limited to using logtype; any attribute can be used as matching criteria. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. Parsing occurs in the pipeline before data enrichments take place. Be careful when defining the matching criteria for a parsing rule. If the criteria is based on an attribute that doesn't exist untail after parsing or enrichment take place, that data won't be present in the logs when matching occurs. As a result, no parsing will happen. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a predefined parsing rule. For example, to query the Application Load Balancer: From the New Relic UI, use the format logtype: alb. From NerdGraph, use the format logtype = 'alb'. To learn what fields are parsed for each rule, see our documentation about built-in parsing rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c Microsoft IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. Learn more about using the infrastructure agent to add attributes. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. To create and manage your own, custom parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing, then click Create parsing rule. Enter the parsing rule's name. Choose an attribute and value to match on. Write your Grok pattern and test the rule. To learn about Grok and custom parsing rules, read our blog post about how to parse logs with Grok patterns. Enable and save the custom parsing rule. To view the list of custom parsing rules: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. To view existing parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. Troubleshooting If parsing is not working the way you intended, it may be due to: Logic: The parsing rule matching logic does not match the logs you want. Timing: If your parsing matching rule targets a value that doesn't exist yet, it will fail. This can occur if the value is added later in the pipeline as part of the enrichment process. Limits: There is a fixed amount of time available every minute to process logs via parsing, patterns, drop filters, etc. If the maximum amount of time has been spent, parsing will be skipped for additional log event records. To resolve these problems, create or adjust your custom parsing rules.",

For more information, try out NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API explorer, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Also see our NerdGraph parsing rules tutorial and drop data tutorial. Headerless HTTP ingest Added support for headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key). This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More data, more power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. For more information, see our documentation about finding data in long logs (blobs) and the Log Event API. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on Add Your Data page. Notes In partnership with our customers, the New Relic log team has been rapidly innovating our log management capabilities since the initial release in 2019. Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business.

In this example, all of the available fields are requested. query { actor { account(id: 12345678) { logConfigurations { parsingRules { accountId createdBy { email gravatar id name } deleted description enabled grok id lucene nrql updatedAt updatedBy { email gravatar id name } } } } } } Copy The response returned will look similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"id\": 12345678, \"logConfigurations\": { \"parsingRules\": [ { \"accountId\": 12345678, \"createdBy\": { \"email\": \"myname@ncompany.com\", \"gravatar\": \"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d0a88888888d666d111111111111111f\", \"id\": 7777777, \"name\": \"My Name\" }, \"deleted\": false, \"description\": \"Integer Test\", \"enabled\": true, \"grok\": \"source=%{NUMBER:test:int}\", \"id\": \"123\", \"lucene\": , \"nrql\": \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `logtype` = 'integer'\", \"updatedAt\": \"2021-08-23T17:25:06.553Z[UTC]\", \"updatedBy\": { \"email\": \"myname@ncompany.com\", \"gravatar\": \"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d0a88888888d666d111111111111111f\", \"id\": 7777777, \"name\": \"My Name\" } } ... Copy Create parsing rules This example creates a new log parsing rule. Before creating the rule, be sure to review the documentation about log parsing and built-in parsing rules. mutation { logConfigurationsCreateParsingRule( accountId: 12345678 rule: { description: \"example parsing rule\" enabled: false grok: \"sampleattribute=%{NUMBER:test:int}\" lucene: \"logtype:testLogs\" nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `logtype` = 'testLogs'\" } ) { rule { id enabled description grok } errors { message type } } } Copy Update parsing rules This example updates the parsing rule whose id is \"123\". You can update any of the following fields as needed: description, enabled, grok, lucene, and nrql. mutation { logConfigurationsUpdateParsingRule( accountId: 12345678 rule: { description: \"example parsing rule\" enabled: false grok: \"sampleattribute=%{NUMBER:test:int}\" lucene: \"logtype:testLogs\" nrql: \"SELECT * FROM Log WHERE `logtype` = 'testLogs'\" } id: \"123\" ) { errors { message type } rule { id grok description enabled } } } Copy Delete parsing rules Deleting a parsing rule doesn't delete data that has already been parsed. The data is retained for a given period of time defined by the retentionPolicy field. mutation { logConfigurationsDeleteParsingRule(accountId: 123456789, id: \"123\") { errors { message type } } } Copy",

      "body": "Parsing is the process of splitting unstructured log data into attributes (key/value pairs). You can use these attributes to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. To get started with parsing, you may want to watch the following video tutorial on YouTube (approx. 4-1/2 minutes). New Relic parses log data according to rules. This document describes how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. You can also create, query, and manage your log parsing rules by using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For more information, see our NerdGraph tutorial for parsing. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule is created with matching criteria that determines which logs the rule will attempt to parse. To simplify the matching process, we recommend adding a logtype attribute to your logs. However, you are not limited to using logtype; any attribute can be used as matching criteria. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. Parsing occurs in the pipeline before data enrichments take place. Be careful when defining the matching criteria for a parsing rule. If the criteria is based on an attribute that doesn't exist untail after parsing or enrichment take place, that data won't be present in the logs when matching occurs. As a result, no parsing will happen. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a predefined parsing rule. For example, to query the Application Load Balancer: From the New Relic UI, use the format logtype: alb. From NerdGraph, use the format logtype = 'alb'. To learn what fields are parsed for each rule, see our documentation about built-in parsing rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c Microsoft IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. Learn more about using the infrastructure agent to add attributes. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. To create and manage your own, custom parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing, then click Create parsing rule. Enter the parsing rule's name. Choose an attribute and value to match on. Write your Grok pattern and test the rule. To learn about Grok and custom parsing rules, read our blog post about how to parse logs with Grok patterns. Enable and save the custom parsing rule. To view the list of custom parsing rules: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. To view existing parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. Troubleshooting If parsing is not working the way you intended, it may be due to: Logic: The parsing rule matching logic does not match the logs you want. Timing: If your parsing matching rule targets a value that doesn't exist yet, it will fail. This can occur if the value is added later in the pipeline as part of the enrichment process. Limits: There is a fixed amount of time available every minute to process logs via parsing, patterns, drop filters, etc. If the maximum amount of time has been spent, parsing will be skipped for additional log event records. To resolve these problems, create or adjust your custom parsing rules.",

For more information, try out NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API explorer, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Also see our NerdGraph parsing rules tutorial and drop data tutorial. Headerless HTTP ingest Added support for headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key). This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More data, more power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. For more information, see our documentation about finding data in long logs (blobs) and the Log Event API. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on Add Your Data page. Notes In partnership with our customers, the New Relic log team has been rapidly innovating our log management capabilities since the initial release in 2019. Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business. To stay up to date the most recent fixes and enhancements, subscribe to our Logs RSS feed. More to come soon!",

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API explorer. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Insights > NRQL Drop Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Manage drop filter rules via NerdGraph API If you want to manage your drop filter rules programmatically, you can use NerdGraph, our graphQL-format API, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For more information, see the NerdGraph tutorial to create, query, and delete your drop filter rules. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy List notification channels with their associated policies This example returns the ID, name, and type for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, as well as a list of every policy that is associated with that channel. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type associatedPolicies { policies { id name } totalCount } } nextCursor totalCount } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email:

notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the channel because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated policies to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

      "body": "Parsing is the process of splitting unstructured log data into attributes (key/value pairs). You can use these attributes to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. To get started with parsing, you may want to watch the following video tutorial on YouTube (approx. 4-1/2 minutes). New Relic parses log data according to rules. This document describes how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. You can also create, query, and manage your log parsing rules by using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For more information, see our NerdGraph tutorial for parsing. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule is created with matching criteria that determines which logs the rule will attempt to parse. To simplify the matching process, we recommend adding a logtype attribute to your logs. However, you are not limited to using logtype; any attribute can be used as matching criteria. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. Parsing occurs in the pipeline before data enrichments take place. Be careful when defining the matching criteria for a parsing rule. If the criteria is based on an attribute that doesn't exist untail after parsing or enrichment take place, that data won't be present in the logs when matching occurs. As a result, no parsing will happen. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a predefined parsing rule. For example, to query the Application Load Balancer: From the New Relic UI, use the format logtype: alb. From NerdGraph, use the format logtype = 'alb'. To learn what fields are parsed for each rule, see our documentation about built-in parsing rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c Microsoft IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. Learn more about using the infrastructure agent to add attributes. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. To create and manage your own, custom parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing, then click Create parsing rule. Enter the parsing rule's name. Choose an attribute and value to match on. Write your Grok pattern and test the rule. To learn about Grok and custom parsing rules, read our blog post about how to parse logs with Grok patterns. Enable and save the custom parsing rule. To view the list of custom parsing rules: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. To view existing parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. Troubleshooting If parsing is not working the way you intended, it may be due to: Logic: The parsing rule matching logic does not match the logs you want. Timing: If your parsing matching rule targets a value that doesn't exist yet, it will fail. This can occur if the value is added later in the pipeline as part of the enrichment process. Limits: There is a fixed amount of time available every minute to process logs via parsing, patterns, drop filters, etc. If the maximum amount of time has been spent, parsing will be skipped for additional log event records. To resolve these problems, create or adjust your custom parsing rules.",

      "body": "After log event data has been shipped to New Relic, it can either be stored in our NRDB database or dropped (discarded). We can drop both log events and event attributes via drop filter rules. You can manage drop filter rules using our Logs UI, as explained in this document. You can also use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API explorer. Savings, security, speed Drop filter rules help you accomplish several important goals: Lower costs by storing only logs relevant to your account. Protect privacy and security by removing personal identifiable information (PII). Reduce noise by removing irrelevant events and attributes. Caution Use caution when deciding to drop data. The data you drop is not recoverable. Before using this feature, review the responsibilities and considerations for dropping data. How drop filter rules work A drop filter rule matches data based on a query. When triggered, the drop filter rule removes the matching data from the ingestion pipeline before it is written to NRDB. This creates an explicit demarcation between the logs being forwarded from your domain and the data that New Relic collects. Since the data removed by the drop filter rule doesn't reach our backend, it cannot be queried: the data is gone and cannot be restored. During the ingestion process, customer log data can be parsed, transformed, or dropped before being stored in New Relic's database. Cautions when dropping data When creating drop rules, you are responsible for ensuring that the rules accurately identify and discard the data that meets the conditions that you have established. You are also responsible for monitoring the rule, as well as the data you disclose to New Relic. New Relic cannot guarantee that this functionality will completely resolve data disclosure concerns you may have. New Relic doesn't review or monitor how effective the rules you develop are. Creating rules about sensitive data can leak information about what kinds of data you maintain, including the format of your data or systems (for example, through referencing email addresses or specific credit card numbers). Any user with the relevant role-based access control permissions can view and edit all information in the rules you create. Create drop filter rules To create and edit drop filters, you must have admin permissions in New Relic, or you must be a member of a role with create and edit permissions for Insights > NRQL Drop Rules. Once a drop filter rule is active, it's applied to all log events ingested from that point onwards. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before creating a rule are not filtered by that rule. Filter or query the set of logs that contain the data you want to drop. Then, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. To create a new drop filter rule, you can use new or existing log queries. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Filter or query to the specific set of logs that contain the data to be dropped. Once the query is active, from Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Create drop filter. Recommendation: Change the drop rule's default name to a meaningful name. Choose to either drop the entire log event that matches the query or just a specific subset of attributes in the matching events. Review the log partitions where this drop rule applies. Save the drop filter rule. Manage drop filter rules via NerdGraph API If you want to manage your drop filter rules programmatically, you can use NerdGraph, our graphQL-format API, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For more information, see the NerdGraph tutorial to create, query, and delete your drop filter rules. Types of drop filter rules The drop filters UI prompts you to select whether to drop logs based on the query or on specific attributes. Drop log events The default type of drop filter rule is to drop logs. This option drops the entire log events that match the filter or query. When creating a rule, try to provide a specific query that only matches log data that should be dropped. Our drop filters process won't let you create drop filter rules without values in the matching query. This prevents badly formed rules from dropping all log data. Drop attributes You can specify attributes to be dropped in a log event that matches your query. At least one or more attributes must be selected. Any attribute which is selected will be dropped; all remaining attributes will be kept and stored in NRDB. Tip We recommend this method for removing fields that could contain personal identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive attributes without losing valuable monitoring data. View or delete drop filter rules To view or delete a drop filter rule: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Drop filters. Click the delete icon next to the drop filter rule you want to remove. Once deleted, rules no longer filter ingested log events.",

      "body": "Parsing is the process of splitting unstructured log data into attributes (key/value pairs). You can use these attributes to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. To get started with parsing, you may want to watch the following video tutorial on YouTube (approx. 4-1/2 minutes). New Relic parses log data according to rules. This document describes how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. You can also create, query, and manage your log parsing rules by using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For more information, see our NerdGraph tutorial for parsing. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule is created with matching criteria that determines which logs the rule will attempt to parse. To simplify the matching process, we recommend adding a logtype attribute to your logs. However, you are not limited to using logtype; any attribute can be used as matching criteria. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. Parsing occurs in the pipeline before data enrichments take place. Be careful when defining the matching criteria for a parsing rule. If the criteria is based on an attribute that doesn't exist untail after parsing or enrichment take place, that data won't be present in the logs when matching occurs. As a result, no parsing will happen. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a predefined parsing rule. For example, to query the Application Load Balancer: From the New Relic UI, use the format logtype: alb. From NerdGraph, use the format logtype = 'alb'. To learn what fields are parsed for each rule, see our documentation about built-in parsing rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c Microsoft IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. Learn more about using the infrastructure agent to add attributes. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. To create and manage your own, custom parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing, then click Create parsing rule. Enter the parsing rule's name. Choose an attribute and value to match on. Write your Grok pattern and test the rule. To learn about Grok and custom parsing rules, read our blog post about how to parse logs with Grok patterns. Enable and save the custom parsing rule. To view the list of custom parsing rules: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. To view existing parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. Troubleshooting If parsing is not working the way you intended, it may be due to: Logic: The parsing rule matching logic does not match the logs you want. Timing: If your parsing matching rule targets a value that doesn't exist yet, it will fail. This can occur if the value is added later in the pipeline as part of the enrichment process. Limits: There is a fixed amount of time available every minute to process logs via parsing, patterns, drop filters, etc. If the maximum amount of time has been spent, parsing will be skipped for additional log event records. To resolve these problems, create or adjust your custom parsing rules.",

Headerless HTTP ingest Added support for headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key). This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More data, more power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. For more information, see our documentation about finding data in long logs (blobs) and the Log Event API. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on Add Your Data page. Notes In partnership with our customers, the New Relic log team has been rapidly innovating our log management capabilities since the initial release in 2019.

      "body": "This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to get your mobile application's overall and version-specific crash count and crash rate, which appear on the Summary page in the upper right corner. These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version. To find the version ID of your mobile application, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) from Mobile where appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' facet appVersionId since 1 day ago export const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"Mobile crash count and crash rate example (v2)\",\"tags\":[\"APIs\",\"REST API v2\",\"Mobile examples (v2)\"],\"metaDescription\":\"How to use New Relic's REST API (v2) to get crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile app or a specific version.\",\"redirects\":[\"/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/mobile-crash-count-crash-rate-example-v2\"]} Copy",

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI. You must also provide APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, and the monitoring enabled BOOLEAN (true or false) even if they are not being modified. curl -X PUT \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"application\": { \"name\": \"name\", \"settings\": { \"app_apdex_threshold\": APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"end_user_apdex_threshold\": BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"enable_real_user_monitoring\": BOOLEAN } } }' Copy This is the equivalent of using the APM UI to change the displayed app name.

After you select your choice of functions for the type of API call (applications, browsers, etc.), the user interface provides an interactive form to view requirements and test your parameter values. It also provides a live source of documentation about the API values. API key requirements Before you can use the API Explorer, API access must be activated and an API key must be generated for your account. Important We recommend using the user key, not the REST API key, because the user key has fewer restrictions. Tips: If you're signed in to New Relic, when you use the API Explorer you can choose your API key at the top of the UI and that key will appear automatically in the Request and Parameters sections of the Explorer. If you're not signed in to New Relic, you can paste your API key into the API Explorer's Parameters. Access the API Explorer To use the New Relic API Explorer: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's menu bar, select the account name for your app from the dropdown list. From the sidebar, select a feature (applications, browsers, etc.) and an available API function: GET, PUT, DELETE. Type the other Parameters values for your API call. (Refer to the UI for descriptions and requirements for v2.) Select the format for your request: JSON or XML. Select Send Request.",

This example shows the time range for a specific 24 hour period. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=requests_per_minute&from=2014-02-21T23:59:00+00:00&to=2014-02-22T23:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Be sure to replace $ { APPID} and $ { APIKEY} with your application ID and API key for the account. To change the time range, include from and to values. To keep the default time period of the last 30 minutes, omit the from and to values. To return a series of throughput values instead of an average, omit summarize. Here is an example of the Throughput chart on the APM Summary page. You can use the New Relic REST API (v2) to return the average Throughput value that appears here. Web app throughput (single host) To find the average throughput from a single host, for a given time period, use a single command to get the metric HttpDispatcher:requests_per_minute, and specify the numeric $ { HOST}.

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI. You must also provide APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, and the monitoring enabled BOOLEAN (true or false) even if they are not being modified. curl -X PUT \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"application\": { \"name\": \"name\", \"settings\": { \"app_apdex_threshold\": APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"end_user_apdex_threshold\": BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"enable_real_user_monitoring\": BOOLEAN } } }' Copy This is the equivalent of using the APM UI to change the displayed app name.

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI.

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version. To find the version ID of your mobile application, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) from Mobile where appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' facet appVersionId since 1 day ago export const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"Mobile crash count and crash rate example (v2)\",\"tags\":[\"APIs\",\"REST API v2\",\"Mobile examples (v2)\"],\"metaDescription\":\"How to use New Relic's REST API (v2) to get crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile app or a specific version.\",\"redirects\":[\"/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/mobile-crash-count-crash-rate-example-v2\"]} Copy",

These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

      "body": "This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to get your mobile application's overall and version-specific crash count and crash rate, which appear on the Summary page in the upper right corner. These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

      "body": "The New Relic REST API (v2) paginates some responses, for performance reasons. This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

      "body": "The New Relic REST API (v2) paginates some responses, for performance reasons. This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

      "body": "The metric timeslice data presented on the Browser page load time chart on your application's Summary page will depend on your web app's configuration. Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. Use the following command to obtain this. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_network_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Page rendering time Page rendering time is a derived value. To calculate it, use this equation: \"Page rendering\" time = EndUser:average_fe_response_time - EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:average_fe_response_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_fe_response_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. DOM processing time The EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time is the time spent in the browser to parse and interpret the HTML. This is measured by the browser's DOM Content event. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds. EndUser:call_count curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count' Copy Request queuing time The EndUser/RB:average_queue_time is the wait time between the web server and the application code. Large numbers indicate a busy application server. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_queue_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds.

This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Important When you add a browser app via API (v2), you can only instrument basic page load timing. To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, set up single page app monitoring via another method. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser applications > POST create.

It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your browser-monitored apps, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command.

      "body": "Here are examples of how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to add apps to browser monitoring or to get a list of your browser apps for a specific API key. This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Important When you add a browser app via API (v2), you can only instrument basic page load timing. To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, set up single page app monitoring via another method. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser applications > POST create. Use the following command: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"browser_application\": { \"name\": ${STRING} } }' Copy The API returns an array of data where the element is a browser application and the data associated with it: { \"browser_application\": { \"id\": \"integer\", \"name\": \"string\", \"browser_monitoring_key\": \"string\", \"loader_script\": \"string\" } Copy API (v2) output Description Browser app id (integer) This is the unique identification code for each app in New Relic One. App name (string) This is the app's name as it appears in the New Relic One. The browser_monitoring_key (string) This a unique key that is linked to (but is not the same as) the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your browser-monitored apps, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List. Use the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy You can use the results to verify the account or name, and to get a copy of the loader script for the app, if needed. View specific browser apps View by name: To view a specific browser app if you know its name, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${NAME} with your app's name in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"filter[name]=${NAME}\" Copy View by browser application ID: To view a specific browser app if you know its ID, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${ID} with your browser application ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=${ID}' Copy View multiple browser apps: To get information for multiple apps, separate the name or ID values with a comma in these commands; for example: -d 'filter[ids]=12345,23456' Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . .

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to get your mobile application's overall and version-specific crash count and crash rate, which appear on the Summary page in the upper right corner. These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version. To find the version ID of your mobile application, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) from Mobile where appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' facet appVersionId since 1 day ago export const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"Mobile crash count and crash rate example (v2)\",\"tags\":[\"APIs\",\"REST API v2\",\"Mobile examples (v2)\"],\"metaDescription\":\"How to use New Relic's REST API (v2) to get crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile app or a specific version.\",\"redirects\":[\"/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/mobile-crash-count-crash-rate-example-v2\"]} Copy",

To change the time range (as shown in this example), include from and to values. To keep the default time period (last 30 minutes), omit the from and to values. To return a series of throughput values instead of an average, omit summarize. Here is an example of the Throughput chart for a non-web app on the APM Summary page. You can use the New Relic REST API (v2) to return the average Throughput value that appears here. Non-web app throughput (single host) To obtain the average throughput for a non-web app from a single host, for a given time period, use a single command to obtain the metric OtherTransaction:requests_per_minute and specify the numeric $ { HOST}. To identify the host, use the UI or the REST API. This example shows the time range for a specific 24 hour period. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/hosts/${HOST}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\     -d 'names[]=OtherTransaction/all&:values[]=requests_per_minute&from=2014-02-21T23:59:00+00:00&to=2014-02-22T23:59:00+00:00&:summarize=true' Copy For more help",

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

      "body": "This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to get your mobile application's overall and version-specific crash count and crash rate, which appear on the Summary page in the upper right corner. These examples use the default time period of the last 30 minutes. To obtain crash data for a different time range, add the time period to the commands. Tip You can also use the New Relic API Explorer to retrieve mobile metric data. Prerequisites To use the API in these examples, you need: Your New Relic REST API key Your New Relic mobile monitoring app ID or your mobile monitoring app version ID. To find the mobile monitoring app ID, see Finding the product ID: mobile monitoring. To find the mobile monitoring app version ID, see Find the mobile app version ID below. Mobile app: Get crash data To obtain crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile application, use the mobile application ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_ID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy The crash_summary output data contains both the crash_count and crash_rate. \"crash_summary\": { \"supports_crash_data\": true, \"unresolved_crash_count\": 14, \"crash_rate\": 28.155339805825243 } Copy To obtain crash summary data for all the mobile applications in the account, use this REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i Copy Mobile app version: Get crash count data To obtain the crash count metric data for a specific version of the mobile application, include the mobile application version ID in the following REST API command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'name=Mobile/Crash/All&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Mobile app version: Get crash rate data To calculate a specific version's crash rate, use the following equation: Crash Rate = (Mobile/Crash/All:call_count) / (Session/Start:call_count) Copy To get the two metric values needed in the equation, use the following REST API command with the mobile application version ID . curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/mobile_applications/${MOBILE_APP_VERSION}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=Mobile/Crash/All&names[]=Session/Start&values[]=call_count&summarize=true' Copy Find the mobile app version ID Important You must provide the version ID only when you want to obtain crash data for a specific version. To find the version ID of your mobile application, run the following NRQL query: SELECT count(*) from Mobile where appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' facet appVersionId since 1 day ago export const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"Mobile crash count and crash rate example (v2)\",\"tags\":[\"APIs\",\"REST API v2\",\"Mobile examples (v2)\"],\"metaDescription\":\"How to use New Relic's REST API (v2) to get crash count and crash rate data for the overall mobile app or a specific version.\",\"redirects\":[\"/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/mobile-crash-count-crash-rate-example-v2\"]} Copy",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

Here's an example: { \"key\": string [required, 1-64 characters uppercase], \"value\": string [required, 1-3,000 characters], \"description\": string [optional] } Copy Here's an example of doing this with a curl command: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials \\ -d '{ \"key\": \"MYKEY\", \"value\": \"my value\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY\" }' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created secure credential specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 303 See Other: The specified key already exists. The returned location header will contain the URI to the key. 400 Bad Request: Key too long or missing, value too long or missing, non-parsable JSON payload. Get all secure credentials To view a list of all the secure credentials in your New Relic account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"secureCredentials\": [ { \"key\": \"MYKEY1\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY1\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"lastUpdated\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\" }, { \"key\": \"MYKEY2\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY2\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"lastUpdated\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\" } ], \"count\": 2 } Copy Get a specific secure credential To view a single secure credential, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"key\": string, \"description\": string, \"createdAt\": date,​ \"lastUpdated\": date } Copy An invalid key will return 404 Not Found: The specified key doesn't exist. Update an existing secure credential To update an existing credential in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY \\ -d '{ \"key\": \"MYKEY\", \"value\": \"my value\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY\" }' Copy An invalid key will return 404 Not Found: The specified key doesn't exist. Delete an existing secure credential To delete an existing credential in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY Copy Please note that if the specified key does not exist, no error will occur.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

      "body": "With the Errors UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page Important As of October 1, 2021, the APM Errors (classic) UI will be discontinued in favor of the New Relic One APM Errors UI. For more details, see our Explorers Hub post. To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit.

To add more detail, or build a dashboard, click the View NRQL button on the chart to see the NRQL powering this view. The graph displays each unique limit type that was reached during the selected time-period. This can help you find any trends based on time. The Limits page also provides a table where you can find the limit name, the limit event message associated with it, and last occurrence time and date. If you click a limit in the table, you see more about what happened, and when. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a limit events table on the Limits UI page. Troubleshooting system limits To troubleshoot limits when you reach them, click the limit info in the table, and then follow the docs link that's provided. Different limits have different solutions. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Distributed tracing: Max age of span timestamp values 20 minutes. Timestamp must be within 20 minutes of current time at ingest or within 20 minutes from the time the last span with the same trace.id was received by New Relic. Distributed tracing: Max spans per minute per account Dependent on agreement. Max limit: 2M. Distributed tracing: Max spans per trace 50K Distributed tracing: Max attributes per span 200 Rate of metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) Ingest: 2 million per minute Rate of names: 4 million per minute per account Number per monitored app: 300K Mobile monitoring: number of crashes reported 10K per hour Infrastructure agents, integrations Number of infrastructure agents and/or integrations: 5K per account Gross number of new monitored containers: 5K per hour per account Query limits NRDB records * inspected: 100 billion per account per hour Rate of queries: 20 per account per second See other query limits * NRDB records refers to database records for our core data types, which includes events, metrics (dimensional), logs, and distributed tracing (span) data, all stored in the New Relic database (NRDB).

      "body": "Parsing is the process of splitting unstructured log data into attributes (key/value pairs). You can use these attributes to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. To get started with parsing, you may want to watch the following video tutorial on YouTube (approx. 4-1/2 minutes). New Relic parses log data according to rules. This document describes how logs parsing works, how to use built-in rules, and how to create custom rules. You can also create, query, and manage your log parsing rules by using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API, at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For more information, see our NerdGraph tutorial for parsing. Example A good example is a default NGINX access log containing unstructured text. It is useful for searching but not much else. Here's an example of a typical line: 127.180.71.3 - - [10/May/1997:08:05:32 +0000] \"GET /downloads/product_1 HTTP/1.1\" 304 0 \"-\" \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" Copy In an unparsed format, you would need to do a full text search to answer most questions. After parsing, the log is organized into attributes, like response code and request URL: { \"remote_addr\":\"93.180.71.3\", \"time\":\"1586514731\", \"method\":\"GET\", \"path\":\"/downloads/product_1\", \"version\":\"HTTP/1.1\", \"response\":\"304\", \"bytesSent\": 0, \"user_agent\": \"Debian APT-HTTP/1.3 (0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.21)\" } Copy Parsing makes it easier to create custom queries that facet on those values. This helps you understand the distribution of response codes per request URL and quickly find problematic pages. How log parsing works Here's an overview of how New Relic implements parsing of logs: Log parsing How it works What All parsing takes place against the message field; no other fields can be parsed. Each parsing rule is created with matching criteria that determines which logs the rule will attempt to parse. To simplify the matching process, we recommend adding a logtype attribute to your logs. However, you are not limited to using logtype; any attribute can be used as matching criteria. When Parsing will only be applied once to each log message. If multiple parsing rules match the log, only the first that succeeds will be applied. Parsing takes place during log ingestion, before data is written to NRDB. Once data has been written to storage, it can no longer be parsed. Parsing occurs in the pipeline before data enrichments take place. Be careful when defining the matching criteria for a parsing rule. If the criteria is based on an attribute that doesn't exist untail after parsing or enrichment take place, that data won't be present in the logs when matching occurs. As a result, no parsing will happen. How Rules can be written in Grok, regex, or a mixture of the two. Grok is a collection of patterns that abstract away complicated regular expressions. If the content of the message field is JSON, it will be parsed automatically. New Relic's log ingestion pipeline can parse data by matching a log event to a rule that describes how the log should be parsed. There are two ways log events can be parsed: Use a built-in rule. Define a custom rule. Rules are a combination of matching logic and parsing logic. Matching is done by defining a query match on an attribute of the logs. Rules are not applied retroactively. Logs collected before a rule is created are not parsed by that rule. The simplest way to organize your logs and how they are parsed is to include the logtype field in your log event. This tells New Relic what built-in ruleset to apply to the logs. Important Once a parsing rule is active, data parsed by the rule is permanently changed. This cannot be reverted. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. Limits Parsing is computationally expensive, which introduces risk. Parsing is done for custom rules defined in an account and for matching patterns to a log. A large number of patterns or poorly defined custom rules will consume a huge amount of memory and CPU resources while also taking a very long time to complete. In order to prevent problems, we apply two parsing limits: per-message-per-rule and per-account. Limit Description Per-message-per-rule The per-message-per-rule limit prevents the time spent parsing any single message from being greater than 100 ms. If that limit is reached, the system will cease attempting to parse the log message with that rule. The ingestion pipeline will attempt to run any other applicable on that message, and the message will still be passed through the ingestion pipeline and stored in NRDB. The log message will be in its original, unparsed format. Per-account The per-account limit exists to prevent accounts from using more than their fair share of resources. The limit considers the total time spent processing all log messages for an account per-minute. The limit is not a fixed value; it scales up or down proportionally to the volume of data stored daily by the account and the environment size that is subsequently allocated to support that customer. Tip To easily check if your rate limits have been reached, go to your system Limits page in the New Relic UI. Built-in parsing rulesets Common log formats have well-established parsing rules already created for them. To get the benefit of built-in parsing rules, add the logtype attribute when forwarding logs. Set the value to something listed in the following table, and the rules for that type of log will be applied automatically. List of built-in rulesets The following logtype attribute values map to a predefined parsing rule. For example, to query the Application Load Balancer: From the New Relic UI, use the format logtype: alb. From NerdGraph, use the format logtype = 'alb'. To learn what fields are parsed for each rule, see our documentation about built-in parsing rules. logtype Example matching query alb AWS Application Load Balancer logtype:alb apache Apache Access logtype:apache cloudfront-web CloudFront Web logtype:cloudfront-web elb Amazon Elastic Load Balancer logtype:elb iis_w3c Microsoft IIS server logs - W3C format logtype:iis_w3c monit Monit logs logtype:monit mysql-error MySQL Error logtype:mysql-error nginx NGINX access logs logtype:nginx nginx-error NGINX error logs logtype:nginx-error route-53 Amazon Route 53 logs logtype:route-53 syslog-rfc5424 Syslog logtype:syslog-rfc5424 Add the logtype attribute When aggregating logs, it's important to provide metadata that makes it easy to organize, search, and parse those logs. One simple way of doing this is to add the attribute logtype to the log messages when they are shipped. Built-in parsing rules are applied by default to certain logtype values. Here are some examples of how to add logtype to logs sent by some of our supported shipping methods. New Relic infrastructure agent example Add logtype as an attribute. You must set the logtype for each named source. Learn more about using the infrastructure agent to add attributes. logs: - name: file-simple file: /path/to/file attributes: logtype: fileRaw - name: nginx-example file: /var/log/nginx.log attributes: logtype: nginx Copy Fluentd example Add a filter block to the .conf file, which uses a record_transformer to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluentd examples. <filter containers> @type record_transformer enable_ruby true <record> #Add logtype to trigger a built-in parsing rule for nginx access logs logtype nginx #Set timestamp from the value contained in the field \"time\" timestamp record[\"time\"] #Add hostname and tag fields to all records hostname \"#{Socket.gethostname}\" tag ${tag} </record> </filter> Copy Fluent Bit example Add a filter block to the .conf file that uses a record_modifier to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Fluent Bit examples. [FILTER] Name record_modifier Match * Record logtype nginx Record hostname ${HOSTNAME} Record service_name Sample-App-Name Copy Logstash example Add a filter block to the Logstash configuration which uses an add_field mutate filter to add a new field. In this example we use a logtype of nginx to trigger the build-in NGINX parsing rule. Check out other Logstash examples. filter { mutate { add_field => { \"logtype\" => \"nginx\" \"service_name\" => \"myservicename\" \"hostname\" => \"%{host}\" } } } Copy Logs API example You can add attributes to the JSON request sent to New Relic. In this example we add a logtype attribute of value nginx to trigger the built-in NGINX parsing rule. Learn more about using the Logs API. POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1 Host: log-api.newrelic.com Content-Type: application/json X-License-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Accept: */* Content-Length: 133 { \"timestamp\": TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_EPOCH, \"message\": \"User 'xyz' logged in\", \"logtype\": \"accesslogs\", \"service\": \"login-service\", \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" } Copy Create custom parsing rules Many logs are formatted or structured in a unique way. In order to parse them, custom logic must be built and applied. From the left nav in the Logs UI, select Parsing, then create your own custom parsing rule with an attribute, value, and Grok pattern. To create and manage your own, custom parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing, then click Create parsing rule. Enter the parsing rule's name. Choose an attribute and value to match on. Write your Grok pattern and test the rule. To learn about Grok and custom parsing rules, read our blog post about how to parse logs with Grok patterns. Enable and save the custom parsing rule. To view the list of custom parsing rules: From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. To view existing parsing rules: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. From Manage Data on the left nav of the Logs UI, click Parsing. Troubleshooting If parsing is not working the way you intended, it may be due to: Logic: The parsing rule matching logic does not match the logs you want. Timing: If your parsing matching rule targets a value that doesn't exist yet, it will fail. This can occur if the value is added later in the pipeline as part of the enrichment process. Limits: There is a fixed amount of time available every minute to process logs via parsing, patterns, drop filters, etc. If the maximum amount of time has been spent, parsing will be skipped for additional log event records. To resolve these problems, create or adjust your custom parsing rules.",

It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

Static status: it overrides any automatic calculation of your workload status. To create or edit the workload status, click the Status details and setup icon from the workload overview. Configure the automatic workload status Important You must have workload management permissions to carry out this configuration. You can use the status of each one of the entities that belong to a workload in order to summarize the workload status into a single value. Not all entities in a workload are equally important from a performance, errors, or availability perspective: You might want your workload to show as disrupted if an essential Synthetics monitor or service has got a critical violation going on. However, if your host infrastructure has a certain redundancy and resilience to outages, you might not need to change your workload status from Operational just because a single host has an alert violation going on. By default, when you create a workload the following rules to calculate its status are added: For entity types close to the digital experience (that is, synthetic monitors, browser applications, mobile applications, and services), the worst available status is propagated. For any other entity type, which are basically infrastructure entities, the best available status is propagated. Create custom rules To customize the automatic workload status, you can define your own rules. A rule consists of a group of entities and a roll up mode: Define the group of entities based on entity types, tag values, GUIDs, or a combination of all of them. Decide how to propagate the status of these entities to the group status: Roll up the best status: the group status matches the less critical status of all belonging entities. Use this option when you want the group status to be operational as long as at least one entity in the group is still operational. Roll up the worst status: the group status matches the most critical status of all belonging entities. Use this option when you want the group status to indicate a degradation or a disruption of service as soon as one entity in the group is not operational. You can also decide to roll up the worst status only after a certain amount of entities are not operational. Save the rule and proceed to create another one if you need to. The final workload status equals the worst status among all the individual group statuses. Important In this final calculation, any automatically calculated status is overridden if a static status has been set by a workload manager. A rule for remaining entities For an easier and more dynamic status configuration, you can use a roll-up type for all entities that aren’t evaluated in any other rule that you have defined before. In particular, if you don't add any other rule at all, the rule for remaining entities will take into account all the entities in the workload. When combined with the grouping by entity type option, this special rule allows you to get a general sense of how each entity type in your workload is doing, without having to configure a rule for each entity type. Therefore, we recommend that you always set a rule for all remaining entities grouped by type, and roll up their worst status to quickly detect when all entities in a layer of your workload stack are not operational. Set a static workload status If you want to communicate the status for your workload regardless of any automatic calculation based on rules, you can set a static status value for your workload from one of the available status values. This is useful during maintenance tasks to communicate to other teams that the status of your workload is disrupted, to provide further information, or to give the time you expect the workload to be operational again. Tip If you regularly need to communicate a temporary status due to your deployment or operations processes, you can automate the static status set up by integrating the API into your workflows. Important Any static status set by a workload manager always overrides any other status values calculated automatically. To set up a static workload status: Set a static status value. Optionally, write a short summary for the status, and a longer description of what’s happening to the workload. Check that the static status is enabled. Understand the status value The workload Overview shows the result of the workload status. If you click on the Status details and setup icon (or just Status details if you don’t have the workload manager role), you’ll see how the status calculation was configured, and the result of all the rules and/or static statuses that were taken into account to calculate the global workload status value. Any change that you make on the workload status configuration will become effective only once you save the changes. For your convenience, while you’re setting the automatic rules or a static status, you’ll get a preview of what the status result would be if you saved the configuration at that point.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this...

View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding browser request data In order to view browser information, you must install the browser agent. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable.

Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent. PHP Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql Threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration is not possible for the PHP agent. Python Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",
