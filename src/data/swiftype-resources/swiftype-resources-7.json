      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field.

Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies.

Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy.

      "body": "This document explains the different ways violations can be closed. How violations automatically close A violation will automatically close when the targeted signal returns to a non-violating state for the time period indicated in the condition's thresholds. This wait time is called the recovery period. For example: If the violating behavior is \"Apdex score below 0.80 at least once in 5 minutes,\" then the violation will automatically close when the Apdex score is equal to or higher than .80 for 5 consecutive minutes. The same applies to a \"for at least x minutes\" threshold: x minutes of non-violating behavior are required to automatically close the violation. When a violation closes automatically: The closing timestamp is backdated to the start of the recovery period. The evaluation resets and restarts from when the previous violation ended. All conditions have a violation time limit setting that will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation. Manually close a violation You can manually close an open violation. This is useful, for example, when a signal has violated the threshold, but it no longer exists and also doesn't have a violation time limit. (A time limit would automatically close a long-lasting violation.) To close a violation: Go to the open violation you want to close. Click Manually close violation. To close all violations associated with a condition: Go to the condition you want to close. Disable the condition and then re-enable it. Important An incident will close automatically when all of its associated critical violations have been closed. Set a time limit for long-lasting violations The violation time limit setting will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the number of days/hours you select. This is most useful for ephemeral entities that, when they disappear, cause a continual violation that won't automatically close. Limits and Defaults All alert violations will have a violation time limit applied to them. Most alert conditions will allow you to edit this field. The default value, if one is not supplied during configuration, is 3 days (24 hours for Infrastructure conditions). The violation time limit for non-Infrastructure conditions can be set as low as 5 minutes, and as high as 30 days. If, for some reason, the signal is still violating in 30 days, the violation will close, and a new violation will open. Infrastructure conditions can be set to the following hours: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, or 72. Examples: You set the violation time limit to 12 hours. If that violation lasts for 12 hours, it will be closed at 12 hours and the condition's evaluation of that entity will be reset. Your JVM has a CPU spike and this creates a violation. The JVM then crashes and is replaced by a new JVM. If you have not set a violation time limit, the crashed JVM’s violation will never close.",

Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "Configuring incident detection consistently across your entire estate helps you track the overall health of your systems, avoid blindspots, and reduce the time it takes to identify and resolve issues. We know that creating accurate alert conditions is anything but simple. Knowing which metrics to monitor, and setting the thresholds accordingly, is a task that few have the necessary knowledge of both their systems and of New Relic to feel confident executing. This results in teams only applying incident detection practices to a subset of critical services. Good news: New Relic One now has an alert condition recommendation service that uses AI and machine learning (ML) to recommend specific metrics and signals to monitor for your specific entities. You can use the provided recommendations or modify them to fit your specific needs. Here’s how you can add recommended alerts to APM entities that do not currently have alert coverage. Using recommended conditions Go to Services - APM in New Relic Navigator and you’ll see a high-density view of the health of your system. With the traffic-light visual, it’s easy to view which entities are healthy, which entities have violations, and which entities do not have any alerts coverage. If an entity does not have alert coverage, its hexagon will be gray. Recommended conditions helps you automatically add alerts to entities that do not have alerts coverage, those gray hexagons. Select an entity: Click an uncovered entity (gray hexagon). A new option will appear on the right-hand side of the screen. Click Create alert condition as shown in the image below. Choose a number of recommended conditions. The recommendations will depend on the quality of the tags associated with an entity. The more accurate and informative the tags are, the more precise the recommendations will be. The image below shows a few possible recommendations based on error percentage, Apdex, and response time.

      "body": "Page load performance measurement continues to evolve. In order to improve the overall performance and user experience, it helps to understand the different metrics and how they relate to each other. Before following the guidance below, narrow your scope to specific pages that you are trying to improve. For maximum impact, focus on pages that are frequently accessed but have a lower than accepted score for the 75th percentile of users. Page Load KPI How to improve time to first byte (TTFB): Time to first byte measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. If users in the 75th percentile are experiencing a TTFB of greater than 0.5s for one or more of your pages, you can break timings down further by querying the following attributes in PageView: backendDuration connectionSetupDuration dnsLookupDuration networkDuration Frequently slowness prior to rendering is caused by slowness in the backend, either from third party APIs or backend applications. Synthetics monitoring for third party APIs helps operations and development teams understand when the root cause is outside of their control. Even if you cannot control the code, you can influence the outcome by sharing synthetics results with the third party to help them understand what your customers are experiencing. If the backend applications are owned by you or your team, you can use APM agents, Pixie, or OpenTelemetry to understand and manage performance. To make cross team communication easier, we recommend implementing Service Level Management boundaries. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Cumulative layout shift is a score that indicates how much content shifts once it has already loaded. General tips and tricks for improving CLS: Specify dimensions for stylesheets and let the browser’s default CSS control the aspect ratio. Statically reserve space for ad slots. Avoid ads near the top of the viewport. Avoid inserting new content above existing content. Precompute sufficient space for embeds. Additional resources: Google’s approach to CLS optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Largest contentful paint measures the difference between the start of page render until the time to paint the largest content element. Common causes for a slow lcp, according to web.dev: Slow server response times Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS Slow resource load times Client-side rendering Use Browser session trace information to understand which of the common causes above factor into the particular page you are trying to optimize. Approaches to improve LCP: Making use of CDNs and paying attention to caching and edge server performance Establishing third party connections early Delaying non-critical Javascript and CSS Additional resources: Google’s approach to LCP optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. First Input Delay (FID) First input delay is the time between when a user first interacts with a page to the time when the browser is able to respond. It’s a field metric that varies based on real user behavior (results vary based on user impatience and action timing) but can be optimized by reducing TBT, total blocking time. To do this, you need to: Break up long blocking tasks. Optimize bloated JavaScript. Look at moving logic server side and/or use web workers to run threads in the background. Use Browser session trace information to understand where your blocking intervals are occurring and for how long they last.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "You can use NRQL queries to create alert conditions. Once you've defined your signal, you can further define your warning and critical threshold levels. This determines when an alerts violation is created. Read on to learn more about how to do this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Click NRQL, and then Next, define thresholds. Tip For more information on key concepts relating to NRQL alert conditions and streaming alerts, see Streaming alerts: key terms and concepts. Create a NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition for a policy: On one.newrelic.com, in the header click Alerts & AI, then in the left sidebar click Policies. Select an existing policy or click New alert policy to create a new policy. Click Add a condition. Under Select a product click NRQL, and then click Next, define thresholds. Create a condition from a chart You can use a chart to create a NRQL alert condition. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu , then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Caution A small number of our older charts don't include the option to create an alert condition. NRQL alert syntax Here's the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. The FACET clause is required for outlier threshold types. It's optional for static and baseline. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Copy Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount Tip If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Required for outlier conditions Include an optional FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depending on the threshold type: static or baseline. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. No LIMIT clause is allowed, but all queries will receive the maximum number of facets possible. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static and baseline conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. Important If the query returns more than the maximum number of values, the alert condition can't be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Modify your query so that it returns a fewer number of values. Reformatting incompatible NRQL Some elements of NRQL used in charts don’t make sense in the streaming context of alerts. Here’s a list of the most common incompatible elements and suggestions for reformatting a NRQL alert query to achieve the same effect. Element Notes SINCE and UNTIL Example: SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE (appId = 837807) SINCE yesterday Copy NRQL Alerting produces a never-ending stream of windowed query results, so the SINCE and UNTIL keywords to scope the query to a point in time are not compatible. As a convenience, we automatically strip SINCE and UNTIL from a query when creating a NRQL Alert Condition from the context of a chart. TIMESERIES In NRQL queries, the TIMESERIES clause is used to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. For NRQL alerts, the equivalent property of a signal is the aggregation window. histogram() The histogram() aggregation function is used to generate histograms. histogram() is not compatible with NRQL alerting: histogram aggregations can not be formatted as a time series. To create an alert from a portion of a histogram (e.g. 95th percentile), use the percentile() aggregation function. Multiple Aggregation Functions Each alert condition can only target a single aggregated stream of data. To alert on multiple streams simultaneously, you’ll need to decompose them into individual conditions within the same policy. Original Query: SELECT count(foo), average(bar), max(baz) from Transaction Copy Decomposed: SELECT count(foo) from Transaction SELECT average(bar) from Transaction SELECT max(baz) from Transaction Copy COMPARE WITH The COMPARE WITH clause is used to compare the values for two different time ranges. This type of query is incompatible with NRQL alerting. We recommend using a Baseline Alert Condition to dynamically detect deviations for a particular signal. SLIDE BY The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows, SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. Sliding windows are not currently supported in NRQL alerts. LIMIT In NRQL queries, the LIMIT clause is used to control the amount of data a query returns, either the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. LIMIT is not compatible with NRQL alerting: evaluation is always performed on the full result set. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) Copy SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Copy Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Copy Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction Copy SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Copy Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Copy Alert conditions and query order of operations By default, the aggregation window is 1 minute, but you can change the window to suit your needs. Whatever the aggregation window, New Relic will collect data for that window using the function in the NRQL alert condition’s query. The query is parsed and executed by our systems in the following order: FROM clause – which event type needs to be grabbed? WHERE clause – what can be filtered out? SELECT clause – what information needs to be returned from the now-filtered data set? Example: null value returned Let's say this is your alert condition query: SELECT count(*) FROM SyntheticCheck WHERE monitorName = 'My Cool Monitor' AND result = 'FAILURE' Copy If there are no failures for the aggregation window: The system will execute the FROM clause by grabbing all SyntheticCheck events on your account. Then it will execute the WHERE clause to filter through those events by looking only for the ones that match the monitor name and result specified. If there are still events left to scan through after completing the FROM and WHERE operations, the SELECT clause will be executed. If there are no remainig events, the SELECT clause will not be executed. This means that aggregators like count() and uniqueCount() will never return a zero value. When there is a count of 0, the SELECT clause is ignored and no data is returned, resulting in a value of NULL. Example: zero value returned If you have a data source delivering legitimate numeric zeroes, the query will return zero values and not null values. Let's say this is your alert condition query, and that MyCoolEvent is an attribute that can sometimes return a zero value. SELECT average(MyCoolAttribute) FROM MyCoolEvent Copy If, in the aggregation window being evaluated, there's at least one instance of MyCoolEvent and if the average value of all MyCoolAttribute attributes from that window is equal to zero, then a 0 value will be returned. If there are no MyCoolEvent events during that minute, then a NULL will be returned due to the order of operations. Tip For more information about this topic, you can check out our blog post on troubleshooting for zero versus null values. Tip You can determine how null values will be handled by adjusting loss of signal and gap filling settings in the Alert Conditions UI. Tip You can avoid NULL values entirely with a query order of operations shortcut. Do this by using a filter sub-clause, then including all filter elements within that sub-clause. The main body of the query will run and return data, at which point the SELECT clause will then run and apply the filter elements. The query will return a value of 0 if the filter elements result in no matching data. Here's an example: SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE result = 'SUCCESS' AND monitorName = 'My Favorite Monitor') FROM SyntheticCheck Copy Nested aggregation NRQL alerts Nested aggregation queries are a powerful way to query your data. However, they have a few restrictions that are important to note. Nested queries with a non-faceted innermost query are not currently supported Without a FACET, the inner query produces a single result, giving the outer query nothing to aggregate. If you're using a nested query, make sure your inner query is faceted. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu) ​​​​​ Copy Queries at all levels must have the same aggregation window size With an alert aggregation window of 1 minute, the inner query would produce two smaller windows of 30 seconds. In theory, these two windows could be aggregated by the outer query. However, this is not currently supported. SELECT max(cpu) FROM (FROM Event SELECT min(cpuTime) as cpu TIMESERIES 30 seconds)​​ Copy Signal loss is not yet supported for nested queries For more information on signal loss, see NerdGraph API: Loss of signal and gap filling. Nested queries containing 'WITH METRIC_FORMAT' in the inner query are not currently supported You can't use a nested query containing the WITH METRIC_FORMAT in the inner query to create NRQL alert conditions. NRQL condition creation tips Here are some tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition threshold types NRQL condition threshold types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For NRQL conditions, you can create a custom description to add to each violation. Descriptions can be enhanced with variable substitution based on metadata in the specific violation. For details, see Description Query results Queries must return a number. The condition evaluates the returned number against the thresholds you've set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Lost signal threshold (loss of signal detection) You can use loss of signal detection to alert on when your data (a telemetry signal) should be considered lost. A signal loss can indicate that a service or entity is no longer online or that a periodic job failed to run. You can also use this to make sure that violations for sporadic data, such as error counts, are closed when no signal is coming in. Advanced signal settings These settings give you options for better handling continuous, streaming data signals that may sometimes be missing. These settings include the aggregation window, the evaluation offset, and an option for filling data gaps. For more on using these, see Advanced signal settings. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Create a concise, descriptive condition name. Provide a custom violation description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Add the runbook URL to include your organization's procedures for handling incidents. You may also add this information to the custom violation description. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions don't affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline (Dynamic) Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Important Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. You can use loss of signal, aggregation duration, and gap filling settings to minimize these false notifications. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum and the preview chart will update accordingly. Set the loss of signal threshold Loss of signal occurs when no data matches the NRQL condition over a specific period of time. You can set your loss of signal threshold duration and and also what happens when the threshold is crossed. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left sidebar click Policies, select a policy, then Add a condition. Loss of signal is only available for NRQL conditions. You may also manage these settings using the GraphQL API (recommended), or the REST API. Go here for specific GraphQL API examples. Loss of signal settings: Loss of signal settings include a time duration and two possible actions. Signal loss expiration time UI label: Signal is lost after: GraphQL Node: expiration.expirationDuration Expiration duration is a timer that starts and resets when we receive a data point in the streaming alerts pipeline. If we don't receive another data point before your 'expiration time' expires, we consider that signal to be lost. This can be because no data is being sent to New Relic or the WHERE clause of your NRQL query is filtering that data out before it is streamed to the alerts pipeline. The loss of signal expiration time is independent of the threshold duration and triggers as soon as the timer expires. The maximum expiration duration is 48 hours. This is helpful when monitoring for the execution of infrequent jobs. The minimum is 30 seconds, but we recommend using at least 3-5 minutes. Loss of signal actions Once a signal is considered lost, you can close open violations, open new violations, or both. Close all current open violations: This closes all open violations that are related to a specific signal. It won't necessarily close all violations for a condition. If you're alerting on an ephemeral service, or on a sporadic signal, you'll want to choose this action to ensure that violations are closed properly. The GraphQL node name for this is \"closeViolationsOnExpiration\" Open new violations: This will open a new violation when the signal is considered lost. These violations will indicate that they are due to a loss of signal. Based on your incident preferences, this should trigger a notification. The graphQL node name for this is \"openViolationOnExpiration\" When you enable both actions, we'll close all open violations first, and then open a new violation for loss of signal. To create a NRQL alert configured with loss of signal detection in the UI: For a policy, when you create a condition, under Select a product, click NRQL, then click Next, define thresholds. Write a NRQL query that returns the values you want to alert on. For Threshold type, select Static or Baseline. Click + Add lost signal threshold, then set the signal expiration duration time in minutes or seconds in the Signal is lost after field. Choose what you want to happen when the signal is lost. You can check one or both of Close all current open violations and Open new \"lost signal\" violation. These control how loss of signal violations will be handled for the condition. Make sure you name your condition before you save it. Violations open due to loss of signal close when the signal comes back. Newly opened lost signal violations will close immediately when new data is evaluated. the condition they belong to expires. By default, conditions expire after 3 days. you manually close the violation with the Close all current open violations option. Tip Loss of signal detection doesn't work on NRQL queries that use nested aggregation or sub-queries. Advanced signal settings When creating a NRQL alert condition, the advanced signal settings gives you better control over streaming alert data and helps you avoid false alarms. When creating a NRQL condition, there are several advanced signal settings: Aggregation window Evaluation offset Fill data gaps To read an explanation of what these settings are and how they relate to each other, see Streaming alerts concepts. Below are instructions and tips on how to configure them. Aggregation window You can set the aggregation window duration to choose how long data is accumulated in a streaming time window before it's aggregated. You can set it to anything between one second and 15 minutes. The default is one minute. Tip Baseline alert condition thresholds don't support editing the aggregation window. They use the 1 minute default. Evaluation offset You can adjust the evaluation offset to coordinate our streaming alerting algorithm with your data's latency. If it takes a while for your data to arrive, then you may need to increase the evaluation offset. The total supported latency is the product of the aggregation window duration multiplied by the evaluation offset. In the example screenshot above, the supported latency is 3 minutes (a 1-minute aggregation window multiplied by three windows). If the data type comes from an APM language agent and is aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend using an evaluation offset of 3 with 1 minute aggregation windows. Important When creating NRQL conditions for data collected from Infrastructure Cloud Integrations such as AWS Cloudwatch or Azure, we recommend that you start with an evaluation offset of 15 minutes, then adjust up or down depending on how long it takes to collect your data. Fill data gaps Gap filling lets you customize the values to use when your signals don't have any data. You can fill gaps in your data streams with one of these settings: None: (Default) Choose this if you don't want to take any action on empty aggregation windows. On evaluation, an empty aggregation window will reset the threshold duration timer. For example, if a condition says that all aggregation windows must have data points above the threshold for 5 minutes, and 1 of the 5 aggregation windows is empty, then the condition won't be in violation. Custom static value: Choose this if you'd like to insert a custom static value into the empty aggregation windows before they're evaluated. This option has an additional, required parameter of fillValue (as named in the API) that specifies what static value should be used. This defaults to 0. Last known value: This option inserts the last seen value before evaluation occurs. We maintain the state of the last seen value for 2 hours. Tip The alerts system fills gaps in actively reported signals. This signal history is dropped after 2 hours of inactivity. For gap filling, data points received after this period of inactivity are treated as new signals. To learn more about signal loss, gap filling, and how to request access to these features, see this Explorers Hub post.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph. See the alerts landing page. Browse New Relic's Explorers Hub for community discussions about Alerts. Find additional help or file a support ticket.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

      "body": "A policy is a group of one or more conditions. This document explains how to create a policy and how to view existing policies. You can also use the REST API. For an explanation of how policies interact with conditions and other components, see Concepts and workflow. Tip The basic setup process is the same, regardless of which product (APM, browser, etc.) uses the policy. The types of metrics and thresholds for conditions vary depending on the monitored data source. Best practices for naming policies We recommend three common patterns and practices for structuring and naming policies: Targets or resources in your architecture that have people responsible for their well being Teams that are responsible for part of the architecture Individual policies for specific users Policies organized by... Comments Architecture Targets or resources in your organization may have different people responsible for their well-being. Common segments may include the environment type (production, staging, integration, development) or the target or resource type (app server code, client-side code, databases, hosts, etc.). To make these types of policies easier to identify, you can give them names based on your architecture. For example: Product A website (production) Product B website (staging) Mobile product app (iOS) Hosts (production) Databases (production) Teams Specific teams may be responsible for parts of your architecture. For example, you may want to name their policy Team: Site engineering, Team: Website development, etc. Individuals Policies set up for specific individuals may be useful when they want to personally keep an eye on a particular resource or metric. This provides them the freedom to add and remove conditions as well as adjust thresholds whenever they want, without having to communicate those changes to others. To make these policies easier to identify, you can include the person's name; for example, User: John Doe's metrics, User: Jane Doe (production), etc. Create an alert policy As part of the policy workflow, start by giving the policy a meaningful name: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. On the policy index page, click New alert policy. Type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Select the incident preference. Select Create alert policy. You can continue from here to define the conditions and assign one or more notification channels. If you decide to continue later, select the policy name from the Alert policies index. Change a policy name For your convenience, we allow you to use the same name for different policies, conditions, and notification channels. If you want to use unique names, review or search the index before adding or changing a name. To rename an existing policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies, and then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Alerts automatically updates any of the policy's conditions and notification channels. View existing policies The policies index lists policies in alphabetical order. To view or search for existing policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Policies. Use the search box, sort any column, or scroll the list. To view detailed information, click a policy name. Tip To view policy and condition information for a specific entity, select the Settings > Alert conditions page from the entity's product UI. Policy maintenance quick reference After you create a policy, you can: Add more conditions to the policy. Edit the conditions' names, targets, or thresholds. Disable conditions. Add one or more notification channels to a policy. Rename or delete the policy. The user interface shows a Last modified timestamp for any changes to policies, including their conditions and notification channels. Here is a quick reference which also includes links to more detailed information and procedures for maintaining your policies. Add or remove policies assigned to a channel To add or remove policies assigned to a channel: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels, then (select a channel). Click Alert policies, then (select a policy). From the selected policy, use the windows to select, remove, or clear all. Change a policy name To rename a policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click the policy name to edit it, then type a meaningful name for the policy (maximum 64 characters). Check policy user assignment To check whether an account user has been assigned any policies: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies, (select a policy), then click Notification channels. Select a user, and then click Alert policies. Check policy channel assignment To check whether a notification channel has any policies assigned to it: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Notification channels. The Policy subscriptions column lists how many policies are assigned to the channel. Create a new policy To create a new alert policy: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Policies. Click New alert policy. Follow standard procedures to complete the basic setup process. Disable a policy You can't disable a policy directly. However, you can disable all of the policy's conditions. When you disable all of the conditions, the policy remains the Alert policies index. The policy itself isn't disabled, and you can re-enable any or all of its conditions at any time. Delete a policy If you delete a policy, we'll continue to apply any other policies assigned to the product entity (target). If you remove all policies for the entity, its color-coded health status indicator will appear light green with an icon. If you delete any of your account's policies, you can't restore them. Instead, you must re-create them if necessary. To delete a policy completely: In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Alert policies. From the policy row, click the delete icon. Any notification channels associated with a deleted or disabled policy will remain. You must delete notification channels or remove them individually as necessary. In a deleted policy, incidents and event violations are provided as a read only resource. Check for entities (targets) assigned to a policy To check whether an entity (target) has any policies assigned: Go to the product (APM, browser, etc.). From the selected product's index, check whether the entity's color-coded health status is light green with an icon. Tip Exception: Infrastructure does not use this feature. Change how threshold violations roll up into incidents To select how violations to your thresholds are grouped into incident records (by policy, by condition, or by target and condition): In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, then (select a policy). Click Incident preference. Get context for alert violations with Incident Intelligence If you use Applied Intelligence, you can connect your conditions to Incident Intelligence. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business. Moving forward, we will be summarizing the most recent fixes and enhancements captured in this ongoing changelog. To stay up to date, subscribe to our Logs RSS feed. More to come soon! New public APIs Public APIs are now available for Parsing and Pipeline Configuration (e.g. drop filters). Documentation can be found within the NerdGraph API explorer, additional external documentation will be made available in September. Headerless HTTP Ingest Added support for Headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key).  This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More Data, More Power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug Fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on \"Add Your Data\" page.",

      "body": "The New Relic Insights query API is a REST API for making NRQL queries. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Requirements and recommendations This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. Use of this API may be restricted by role-related user permissions. To add custom data to New Relic, you'd use our data ingest APIs. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. 1. Register an API key To use the Insights query API, you need a query key. You can have multiple query keys, and any query key can be used to initiate any Insights API query. If you have multiple systems querying Insights or different data destinations, New Relic recommends you use multiple query keys to enhance data security. For security reasons, query keys cannot be altered or read using the API. To change or read a query key, use the New Relic UI. Tip This API is no longer the preferred way to query New Relic data. Please use NerdGraph to do that. To create a new query key: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys. Select the plus icon next to the Query keys heading. Enter a short description of the key. Select Save your notes. 2. Create the API query request When you create or edit a query key, you will see an example curl query that you can use as a template. The example query won't work unless you follow these query rules: The NRQL query string must be URL-encoded. The query string must be less than 4000 bytes. The URL must contain a valid account ID. The X-Query-Key must contain a valid query key. The Content-Type must be application/json. Linux Here is a curl example: curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY\" Copy Microsoft Windows You can use Powershell to query events via API: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=YOUR_URL_ENCODED_QUERY -Headers @{\"X-Query-Key\"=\"YOUR_QUERY_KEY\"} -ContentType \"application/json\" -Method GET Copy 3. Process the returned JSON The query API returns results in JSON format. There is a limit of 2,000 results per request. The structure of the JSON data depends on the NRQL that you used in the request: Different combinations of SELECT statements, clauses, and functions each return an appropriate response. When writing your code to process the JSON, you should do a test run of your query and examine the resulting JSON. Example The Insights query API returns JSON data. Here's an example of a query, its query request format, and its returned data: Query, query API request, returned data Original NRQL query: SELECT count(appName) FROM PageView SINCE '2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500' Copy Query cURL request (with URL-encoded NRQL query): curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key: YOUR_QUERY_KEY\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/query?nrql=SELECT+count%28appName%29+FROM+PageView+SINCE+%272014-08-04+00%3A00%3A00%2B0500%27\" Copy Returned JSON data: { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 80275388 } ], \"metadata\": { \"eventTypes\": [ \"PageView\" ], \"eventType\": \"PageView\", \"openEnded\": true, \"beginTime\": \"2014-08-03T19:00:00Z\", \"endTime\": \"2017-01-18T23:18:41Z\", \"beginTimeMillis=\": 1407092400000, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"rawSince\": \"'2014-08-04 00:00:00+0500'\", \"rawUntil\": \"`now`\", \"rawCompareWith\": \"\", \"clippedTimeWindows\": { \"Browser\": { \"beginTimeMillis\": 1483571921198, \"endTimeMillis\": 1484781521198, \"retentionMillis\": 1209600000 } }, \"messages\": [], \"contents\": [ { \"function\": \"count\", \"attribute\": \"appName\", \"simple\": true } ] } } Copy Rate limiting guidelines We have query rate limits. You likely won't encounter these limits, especially if you follow these general guidelines: Limit the amount of requests with complex queries (for example, queries with FACET or TIMESERIES clauses, or queries of over a million events) run at the same time. Limit the amount of requests run concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of 5, especially if they include complex queries. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for the number of queries per minute, the query API returns a 429 error. If New Relic applies rate limits on your account for records inspected, the query API returns a 503 error and your charts may display timeout error messages.",

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Do not use the Insights Dashboards API. Instead, use the New Relic One Dashboards API with NerdGraph, our GraphQL API. End of life notice The Insights Dashboard API reaches end of life in 2021. As of July 28, 2021, the CREATE and UPDATE endpoints are not available. As of August 30, 2021, the GET and DELETE endpoints are not available. To make the transition from the Insights Dashboard API to the New Relic One Dashboards API, see our migration guide. For more information, see the NerdGraph dashboards tutorial and Explorers Hub post. Requirements If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Overview The Insights Dashboard API allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete new or existing dashboards. New Relic's API Explorer includes the cURL request format, available parameters, response status codes, and JSON response structure for available API calls. Example use cases The Insights Dashboard API is a flexible solution for many different use cases. Here are a few examples of how you can leverage the Dashboard API to solve problems: Automatically create dashboards for new teams or services pre-populated with standard organization metrics and charts. Use the API to view dashboard schemas, and save them in a central repository for source control and backups. Create widget and dashboard templates to allow teams to self-service. Account and data security The Dashboard API includes safeguards to help ensure account and data security. Requirements Comments User key and permissions Required: This API requires a user key. You cannot use your account-level REST API key to manage dashboards. Cross-account widgets You can view cross-account widgets on a dashboard by using the Insights or New Relic One dashboards UI. However, the ability to view cross-account widgets when using the Dashboard API has these restrictions: To view the list of widgets on a specific dashboard with the Dashboard API, you must use the SHOW endpoint. To view a widget in the API payload, the widget's account ID must be the same as the account ID for the payload. If the account ID is not the same, the widget's details will not be listed. Instead, the widget's payload will show: \"visualization\": \"inaccessible\" Copy Use the API Explorer To view the Dashboard API options in the API Explorer: Log in to your New Relic account. Go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore. From the API Explorer's Select an account and key dropdown, select a user key. Select Dashboards, then select the API function. To use API functions with existing dashboards, include the dashboard id. To find the dashboard id, select the LIST endpoint, and apply filtering options. View Dashboard API video Follow along with this step-by-step tutorial to learn how to find your API keys, create new dashboards, view and update existing dashboards via the REST API. For a step-by-step guide to using the New Relic API Explorer to manage Insights dashboards, watch this video (approximately 6 minutes). Or, go directly to the full online course about New Relic APIs. Use API endpoints The API supports the following functions for Insights dashboards only. The API does not support these functions for data apps (collections of linked dashboards). API endpoints Comments CREATE POST /v2/dashboards Create a new dashboard. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to POST more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more widgets to the dashboard, use the Insights UI. UPDATE PUT /v2/dashboards/:id: Update an existing dashboard for the dashboard id. The API permits a maximum of 300 widgets when creating or updating a dashboard. Attempting to PUT more than 300 widgets will produce an error. To add more or edit existing widgets on the dashboard, use the Insights UI. SHOW GET /v2/dashboards/:id: View an existing dashboard and all accessible widgets for the dashboard id. To help ensure data security, the SHOW function returns only the dashboard widgets that the user has permission to view. If a dashboard includes widgets that the user is not authorized to view, the API will provide a placeholder with the visualization field set to inaccessible. LIST GET /v2/dashboards?page=:page:&per_page=:count: View a paginated list of dashboards. The list shows filterable dashboard metadata only; no widgets will appear in the list. Search options include: filter[title] as substring search filter[category] (all / favorites / mine} filter[created_after] as ISO date filter[created_before] as ISO date filter[updated_after] as ISO date filter[updated_before] as ISO date Sort options include: name recently_viewed last_edited If no sort option is provided, results will be ordered by id. Pagination options include the page and per_page fields. The per_page field controls the number of results per page with a default and maximum of 100 results. The response will include a pagination Link header, which provides next page and last page links. DELETE DELETE /v2/dashboards/:id: Delete an existing dashboard indicated by the dashboard id. Dashboard API schema JSON is the only supported format. When using API functions, be sure to add .json to the end of the request URL, as shown in the API Explorer. Important Widgets have a size limit of 3x3 (height and width may not exceed 3). Caution The Dashboard API 3-column restriction also applies to the dashboards you upload to New Relic One dashboards. If you update a dashboard with a different layout using the API, the uploaded dashboard will revert to the 3-column configuration.

      "body": "This document contains general requirements and rules for inserting and using custom events and their associated attributes. Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data. Event types include: Default events from New Relic agents Custom events from New Relic agents Custom events from Insights custom event inserter",

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "This doc contains information and procedures pertaining to the structure of the docs site, including: the nav files, the sidebar, docs category (index) views, and more. For succinct instructions, see Procedures, but it is highly recommended you understand the general concepts of how the docs site structure works if you will be doing larger docs site projects. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Nav files: In the github docs site, there are yaml files under the nav folder that are used to determine the docs site structure that we display. This structure is exposed in the docs site left sidebar and when you view docs category views (also known as index views, like this one). Folder: We sometimes use \"folders\" to refer to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content section). This is a way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar and index view are both determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or subcategory: we use these words a bit interchangeably to refer to the various levels of docs site categories. For example, this view shows a list of docs in a specific category, as does this higher level category view. Index: In this context, an \"index\" is sometimes used to refer to a view of a certain category of docs (like this one). \"Index\" and \"category\" can be used a bit interchangably, but the gist is that the \"index\" term refers to a docs category being displayed in a page load. (Note that this is a different, more general use of the term than the index.mdx files that are used to build landing pages.) Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual docs folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure that we display (e.g., the structure shown in the sidebar and category views like this one). The displayed structure of the docs site is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the displayed site structure, which is used for the sidebar and category views, without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely parallel and matching. Because these two things are so separate, it means we have some fairly complex behind-the-scenes logic to get them to work together. And this means that there can be fairly unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes, and this means that you will have to add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL, so that means you would have to add a redirect to that doc for its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls these things: The docs structure (the various levels of docs) for that category of docs. The category headers, set by title (e.g., \"On-host integrations list\") and path (e.g., \"/docs/integrations/on-host-integrations\"). The doc information, set by title (e.g., \"NGINX integration\") and path (the doc's URL). A category and a doc in a nav file have the same elements: a title and a `path. What separates a category from a doc is that: A category contains docs in the level below it. If a category has a path (which isn't required but should be present for most docs), the path points to a content docs folder that has at least one doc in it. For more on nav file format, see Nav file format Where is the docs site structure exposed? The structure set in the nav files is exposed in two places: The left sidebar of a doc that shows the structure of that category. When a category header in the sidebar is clicked, it shows a view of that docs site category. Doc category views, also sometimes called index views: for example, this view, which shows a particular section of docs. What determines a doc's sidebar? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure governed by the nav files is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL in the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. If it finds that doc in more than one nav file, it attempts to find the right nav file by choosing the nav that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with a relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. For an example of a doc that is placed in two different nav files, in this category view click the Manage data doc and see how, when it loads, it displays the sidebar for the nav file that better matches its URL. When you click a sidebar category, what determines how that category view displays? When you click on a docs category header in the sidebar and a docs category view loads (like this one), what governs what is displayed there? Here is how this process works: A category header in the sidebar has an associated URL, which is set in the nav file. In the example nav file snippet below, the Get started category view has a path set to /docs/apis/intro-apis. This is what governs the sidebar heading title of \"Get started\" and tells it the URL to use. - title: APIs path: /docs/apis pages: - title: Get started path: /docs/apis/intro-apis pages: - title: New Relic APIs path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis - title: API keys path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys Copy If the associated folder of that path has an index mdx file (representing a landing page, like this one), the docs site displays that landing page. If there is no landing page, we check to see if that path matches an actual folder that has at least one mdx file. In other words, if we instead put in a completely arbitrary URL path for a category path, like docs/random-category/random-category-2, it would not work. It requires an existing folder with at least one doc in there. Other aspects to consider: Note that a category doesn't need a path link in the nav file; that is just what tells it to create a link and a URL for that view. If a category in a nav file lacks a path, it won't have a link or associated URL for it (for an example, see the \"New Relic University\" category in this section). Having a category without an associated link/URL can be an acceptable choice if you are creating a category of docs that don't reside in that section and you simply want to give a helpful category view in the sidebar. Note that every URL based on actual folder structure can create a theoretical URL. For example, here's a URL based on an actual folder containing one doc. But because there is no path in a nav file corresponding to that URL, it doesn't display anything. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents pages: - title: Agent data path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc or the category view. Do not use trailing slashes. For docs categories in the nav file, the path is required to create an index view. Without the path, a docs category won't be clickable as a link and won't display a view of those docs. Learn more about index views. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide rootNav: false Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. It may help you to review the terms we use before starting a procedure. Procedures include: Add a new category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create a \"dummy\" category for docs that don’t live in that area Make a category heading clickable Troubleshoot messed up category views Add a new category We'll explain two procedures: adding a subcategory of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file. Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare, and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the structure of existing nav files as a template. For more on structure, see nav format. Tip You need at least one level of nesting inside the nav file. Without that, doc titles in the auto-generated category views will render as H2 headings. For example, src/content/level-one/level-two/doc will work, but src/content/level-one/doc will produce strange formatting. If you don't want your new nav to appear on the main landing page, add rootNav: false to your .yml file. (For an example of this, see src/nav/style-guide.yml.) Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title and path. If you're adding a path for that category (recommended), it must use the URL of an existing folder with at least one mdx file in it. Add the docs you want in that section. Ensure your new content matches the indenting of the surrounding nav file. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined If a category view isn't clickable, see Make category view clickable. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in one or more nav files. To do this: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the indenting based on the surrounding nav file content or other nav files. Add doc in multiple sidebar locations To add a doc in more than one sidebar location, simply add that doc (its title and path) wherever you want it to be in the nav file. For more on how the sidebar is determined for docs in multiple nav files, see Sidebar. You can add a doc URL in multiple nav file locations. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file You would move a doc in the nav file when you want to change its location in the displayed docs site structure (i.e., the sidebar and docs category views). To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure that new content is aligned properly with the surrounding nav file content. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move docs between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming very different, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create issues with category view displays or sidebar actions. Too much divergence can make finding and editing docs harder, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL. Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about ways to programmatically add redirects. Remove the trailing slash. Move the doc to the new folder. Update nav files with the new URL. This is easily overlooked but having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. If you are moving an entire folder or multiple folders to another folder, docs and all: Simply move these folders using your preferred method (e.g., using drag and drop) to the new location. Next, because that move changes all the URLs of the docs and categories, you'll need to add redirects: For adding redirects for docs, see the procedures for moving a doc between folders. For category redirects: For the section of the nav file affected by your folder editing, gather all the category URLs (path fields) that relate to the moved or deleted folders. We don't need to redirect all folder-related URL paths: we only need to redirect the nav file paths because those represent the paths that we actually link to in the docs (in other words: we aren't using folder-based URLs if they don't have a nav file path). Add those category path URLs as redirects in specific docs or, if that won't work, in the taxonomy-redirects file. We should aim to add category redirects in specific docs and the reason for this is that the taxonomy-redirects file is hard to use and because it's a better customer experience to land on a doc versus a category if possible. In most cases, you'll be able to find a fitting doc to redirect to but if only a category view makes sense, use the taxonomy redirects file. For larger projects, this can be tough work, so you'll want to check out the build and make sure all the sidebar links and category headers are working as expected. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: either moving or deleting the docs in those folders first, gathering the affected category path URLs and adding them as redirects, adn then deleting the empty folders. Create a \"dummy\" sub-category of docs that don't live in that category Sometimes you want to create a category of docs that is there to help expose a related doc or set of docs. For example, in this view, we have added a category for 'New Relic University' even though that's not a doc that lives in that section; in this case, it's not even a doc on our site. In the example above, this 'New Relic University' category header is in regular text and not a link, and that's because it doesn't have a path set for it in the nav file. This also means that in the sidebar, this category header is not a clickable link and simply functions as a collapser/expander. This is acceptable if you don't mind it but below we explain how you can get a clickable category if you need it. To create a so-called \"dummy\" category: Add the category structure you want in the nav file. If you're okay not having a clickable category header, your new category doesn't require a path. If you want a clickable category header, you will need to use or create a folder that matches the new category path and that has at least one mdx file in it (details). In the nav file, add the title and path information for the docs you want in that new category. Test your new category to ensure it is working correctly. Make a sidebar category heading clickable If there's a sidebar category that's only acting as an expander/collapser and doesn't have a link, that's because it either a) doesn't have a path set in the nav file, or b) that path goes to a folder that doesn't have a doc in it. For more on this, see the instructions regarding clickable headers in the \"dummy\" category section. Troubleshoot category views not working correctly If a docs category view is not working correctly, review how category views are formed. If this does happen, get another opinion from another tech writer to make sure you're not missing something, as we should rarely have problems. One reason that a category view might not work is specifically for path URLs that are also landing pages. In this case, if that path is used in more than one location in the same nav file, the docs site can be confused about which category view to use. We may fix this with a coding fix but in meantime: consider pointing to other URLs and not that path, so that there's only one use of that path per nav file.",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments.

      "body": "This doc contains information and procedures pertaining to the structure of the docs site, including: the nav files, the sidebar, docs category (index) views, and more. For succinct instructions, see Procedures, but it is highly recommended you understand the general concepts of how the docs site structure works if you will be doing larger docs site projects. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Nav files: In the github docs site, there are yaml files under the nav folder that are used to determine the docs site structure that we display. This structure is exposed in the docs site left sidebar and when you view docs category views (also known as index views, like this one). Folder: We sometimes use \"folders\" to refer to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content section). This is a way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar and index view are both determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or subcategory: we use these words a bit interchangeably to refer to the various levels of docs site categories. For example, this view shows a list of docs in a specific category, as does this higher level category view. Index: In this context, an \"index\" is sometimes used to refer to a view of a certain category of docs (like this one). \"Index\" and \"category\" can be used a bit interchangably, but the gist is that the \"index\" term refers to a docs category being displayed in a page load. (Note that this is a different, more general use of the term than the index.mdx files that are used to build landing pages.) Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual docs folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure that we display (e.g., the structure shown in the sidebar and category views like this one). The displayed structure of the docs site is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the displayed site structure, which is used for the sidebar and category views, without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely parallel and matching. Because these two things are so separate, it means we have some fairly complex behind-the-scenes logic to get them to work together. And this means that there can be fairly unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes, and this means that you will have to add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL, so that means you would have to add a redirect to that doc for its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls these things: The docs structure (the various levels of docs) for that category of docs. The category headers, set by title (e.g., \"On-host integrations list\") and path (e.g., \"/docs/integrations/on-host-integrations\"). The doc information, set by title (e.g., \"NGINX integration\") and path (the doc's URL). A category and a doc in a nav file have the same elements: a title and a `path. What separates a category from a doc is that: A category contains docs in the level below it. If a category has a path (which isn't required but should be present for most docs), the path points to a content docs folder that has at least one doc in it. For more on nav file format, see Nav file format Where is the docs site structure exposed? The structure set in the nav files is exposed in two places: The left sidebar of a doc that shows the structure of that category. When a category header in the sidebar is clicked, it shows a view of that docs site category. Doc category views, also sometimes called index views: for example, this view, which shows a particular section of docs. What determines a doc's sidebar? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure governed by the nav files is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL in the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. If it finds that doc in more than one nav file, it attempts to find the right nav file by choosing the nav that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with a relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. For an example of a doc that is placed in two different nav files, in this category view click the Manage data doc and see how, when it loads, it displays the sidebar for the nav file that better matches its URL. When you click a sidebar category, what determines how that category view displays? When you click on a docs category header in the sidebar and a docs category view loads (like this one), what governs what is displayed there? Here is how this process works: A category header in the sidebar has an associated URL, which is set in the nav file. In the example nav file snippet below, the Get started category view has a path set to /docs/apis/intro-apis. This is what governs the sidebar heading title of \"Get started\" and tells it the URL to use. - title: APIs path: /docs/apis pages: - title: Get started path: /docs/apis/intro-apis pages: - title: New Relic APIs path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/introduction-new-relic-apis - title: API keys path: /docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys Copy If the associated folder of that path has an index mdx file (representing a landing page, like this one), the docs site displays that landing page. If there is no landing page, we check to see if that path matches an actual folder that has at least one mdx file. In other words, if we instead put in a completely arbitrary URL path for a category path, like docs/random-category/random-category-2, it would not work. It requires an existing folder with at least one doc in there. Other aspects to consider: Note that a category doesn't need a path link in the nav file; that is just what tells it to create a link and a URL for that view. If a category in a nav file lacks a path, it won't have a link or associated URL for it (for an example, see the \"New Relic University\" category in this section). Having a category without an associated link/URL can be an acceptable choice if you are creating a category of docs that don't reside in that section and you simply want to give a helpful category view in the sidebar. Note that every URL based on actual folder structure can create a theoretical URL. For example, here's a URL based on an actual folder containing one doc. But because there is no path in a nav file corresponding to that URL, it doesn't display anything. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents pages: - title: Agent data path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc or the category view. Do not use trailing slashes. For docs categories in the nav file, the path is required to create an index view. Without the path, a docs category won't be clickable as a link and won't display a view of those docs. Learn more about index views. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide rootNav: false Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. It may help you to review the terms we use before starting a procedure. Procedures include: Add a new category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create a \"dummy\" category for docs that don’t live in that area Make a category heading clickable Troubleshoot messed up category views Add a new category We'll explain two procedures: adding a subcategory of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file. Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare, and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the structure of existing nav files as a template. For more on structure, see nav format. Tip You need at least one level of nesting inside the nav file. Without that, doc titles in the auto-generated category views will render as H2 headings. For example, src/content/level-one/level-two/doc will work, but src/content/level-one/doc will produce strange formatting. If you don't want your new nav to appear on the main landing page, add rootNav: false to your .yml file. (For an example of this, see src/nav/style-guide.yml.) Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title and path. If you're adding a path for that category (recommended), it must use the URL of an existing folder with at least one mdx file in it. Add the docs you want in that section. Ensure your new content matches the indenting of the surrounding nav file. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined If a category view isn't clickable, see Make category view clickable. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in one or more nav files. To do this: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the indenting based on the surrounding nav file content or other nav files. Add doc in multiple sidebar locations To add a doc in more than one sidebar location, simply add that doc (its title and path) wherever you want it to be in the nav file. For more on how the sidebar is determined for docs in multiple nav files, see Sidebar. You can add a doc URL in multiple nav file locations. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file You would move a doc in the nav file when you want to change its location in the displayed docs site structure (i.e., the sidebar and docs category views). To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure that new content is aligned properly with the surrounding nav file content. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move docs between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming very different, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create issues with category view displays or sidebar actions. Too much divergence can make finding and editing docs harder, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL. Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about ways to programmatically add redirects. Remove the trailing slash. Move the doc to the new folder. Update nav files with the new URL. This is easily overlooked but having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. If you are moving an entire folder or multiple folders to another folder, docs and all: Simply move these folders using your preferred method (e.g., using drag and drop) to the new location. Next, because that move changes all the URLs of the docs and categories, you'll need to add redirects: For adding redirects for docs, see the procedures for moving a doc between folders. For category redirects: For the section of the nav file affected by your folder editing, gather all the category URLs (path fields) that relate to the moved or deleted folders. We don't need to redirect all folder-related URL paths: we only need to redirect the nav file paths because those represent the paths that we actually link to in the docs (in other words: we aren't using folder-based URLs if they don't have a nav file path). Add those category path URLs as redirects in specific docs or, if that won't work, in the taxonomy-redirects file. We should aim to add category redirects in specific docs and the reason for this is that the taxonomy-redirects file is hard to use and because it's a better customer experience to land on a doc versus a category if possible. In most cases, you'll be able to find a fitting doc to redirect to but if only a category view makes sense, use the taxonomy redirects file. For larger projects, this can be tough work, so you'll want to check out the build and make sure all the sidebar links and category headers are working as expected. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: either moving or deleting the docs in those folders first, gathering the affected category path URLs and adding them as redirects, adn then deleting the empty folders. Create a \"dummy\" sub-category of docs that don't live in that category Sometimes you want to create a category of docs that is there to help expose a related doc or set of docs. For example, in this view, we have added a category for 'New Relic University' even though that's not a doc that lives in that section; in this case, it's not even a doc on our site. In the example above, this 'New Relic University' category header is in regular text and not a link, and that's because it doesn't have a path set for it in the nav file. This also means that in the sidebar, this category header is not a clickable link and simply functions as a collapser/expander. This is acceptable if you don't mind it but below we explain how you can get a clickable category if you need it. To create a so-called \"dummy\" category: Add the category structure you want in the nav file. If you're okay not having a clickable category header, your new category doesn't require a path. If you want a clickable category header, you will need to use or create a folder that matches the new category path and that has at least one mdx file in it (details). In the nav file, add the title and path information for the docs you want in that new category. Test your new category to ensure it is working correctly. Make a sidebar category heading clickable If there's a sidebar category that's only acting as an expander/collapser and doesn't have a link, that's because it either a) doesn't have a path set in the nav file, or b) that path goes to a folder that doesn't have a doc in it. For more on this, see the instructions regarding clickable headers in the \"dummy\" category section. Troubleshoot category views not working correctly If a docs category view is not working correctly, review how category views are formed. If this does happen, get another opinion from another tech writer to make sure you're not missing something, as we should rarely have problems. One reason that a category view might not work is specifically for path URLs that are also landing pages. In this case, if that path is used in more than one location in the same nav file, the docs site can be confused about which category view to use. We may fix this with a coding fix but in meantime: consider pointing to other URLs and not that path, so that there's only one use of that path per nav file.",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls.

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml.

It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls.

Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business. Moving forward, we will be summarizing the most recent fixes and enhancements captured in this ongoing changelog. To stay up to date, subscribe to our Logs RSS feed. More to come soon! New public APIs Public APIs are now available for Parsing and Pipeline Configuration (e.g. drop filters). Documentation can be found within the NerdGraph API explorer, additional external documentation will be made available in September. Headerless HTTP Ingest Added support for Headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key).  This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More Data, More Power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug Fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on \"Add Your Data\" page.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license.

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "Our Incident Intelligence uses logic to correlate your incidents. We call these logic \"decisions.\" We have built-in decisions and you can create and customize your own on the Incident Intelligence Decisions UI page. The more optimally you configure decisions, the better we will group and correlate your incident events, resulting in reduced noise and increased context for on-call teams. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Our UI shows how each decision correlates incidents. Key concepts Here are some key concepts for understanding our decisions logic: What is \"correlation\" and how does it work? For the incident events being sent into Incident Intelligence from your various alerting engines, the most recently created and active incidents are available for correlation. Correlation occurs between two events whenever the criteria in any decision is met. All the events available for correlation are tested against each other in all possible pair combinations and a \"greedy merge\" is performed. This means that if incident A correlates with B into an issue and incident B correlates with incident C into another issue, then AB and BC will also merge together resulting in a single issue including A, B, and C. What types of logic can be used in a decision? At a high level, decisions allow you to define logic based on time (duration between events), frequency (number of events), context (metadata structure & values), and topology (entity relationships). Review your active decisions Decisions determine how Incident Intelligence correlates incidents together. By default, a broad set of global decisions is enabled when you start using Incident Intelligence. To review existing decisions: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. In the left navigation, under Incident Intelligence, click Decisions. Review the list of active decisions. To see the rule logic that creates correlations between your issues, click the decision. To see examples of incidents the decision correlated, click the Recent correlations tab. Use any of the other options to enable or disable these global decisions. Your decisions will routinely be analyzed for their efficacy as well as other best practices, and recommendations will be attached for review. Correlation statistics Whether you want to use the suggested decisions we provide using our pattern recognition algorithms, or you want to add in your own correlation logic, you'll get insights into your correlation rate, noise reduction improvement, and the number of correlated issues arising, as shown below. From the UI, you can view the underlying NRQL queries and create your own custom charts and dashboards from this data. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Some example statistics from the decisions UI. Some definitions of statistics: Correlation rate: The percentage of the time correlations are occurring versus not. Total correlated issues: Number of issues correlated with another issue. Noise reduction: Total number of issues after correlation divided by the total number of issues before correlation. Correlation reason: Shows which decisions are correlating issues the most. Use suggested decisions Information about the types of suggested decisions: Suggested decisions: The data from your selected sources is continuously inspected for patterns to help reduce noise. Once patterns have been observed in your data, decisions are suggested that would allow these events to correlate in the future. Accelerated suggested decisions: If you have been using New Relic Alerts for a while, when you add alert policies to sources, we're able to use that historical data to accelerate the pattern recognition step and suggest decisions up to 30% faster. To get started, click on a suggested decision, located under the statistics block on the Decisions UI page. You'll see information on the logic behind the suggested decision, why we think it will help you, and the estimated correlation rate for that decision. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Suggested decision block If there isn't enough data to see the correlation rate, a link right below the percentage estimate will guide you to other sources you can add to get stronger results. Note: if you have less than 5000 incidents per month, you probably won't have suggested decisions. To add the suggested decision, click Activate decision and it will appear enabled, alongside the other decisions. If the decision isn't relevant to your needs, click Dismiss. Create custom decisions You can reduce noise and improve correlation by building your own custom decisions. To start building a decision, go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. In the left navigation, under Incident Intelligence, click Decisions, then click Add a decision. Tips on how to use that UI are in the table below. When building a decision, steps 1, 2 and 3 are optional on their own but at least one must be defined in order to create a decision. Option Description Step 1: Filter your data In this step you'll define your filters. Remember correlation occurs between two incidents. If no filters are defined all incoming Incidents will be considered by the decision. Define your filters for the first segment (or bucket) of incidents, and the second segment of Incidents. Types of filter operators range from substring matching to regex matching to help you target the incident events you want and exclude those you don't. All combination of event pairs between segment one and segment two are used in the next steps of the decision. Step 2: Contextual correlation Once you've filtered your data, define the logic used when comparing the incidents' context. You can correlate events based on the following methods: Attribute value comparisons with standard operators Attribute value similarity using similarity algorithms Attribute value regex with capture groups Entire incident comparisons using similarity or clustering algorithms Step 3: Topology correlation Topology correlation is currently in limited release. Contact your account representative to enable this feature. Once enabled, you'll first need to ingest your topology data via our NerdGraph aiTopologyCollector (search for aiTopology in the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer). This allows any topology-related decision to be matched with your topology data. Learn more about setting up topology correlation. Give it a name After you configure your decision logic, give it a recognizable name and description. This is used in notifications and other areas of the UI to indicate which decision caused a pair of incidents to be correlated together. Advanced settings Optional. The advanced settings area allows you to further customize how your decision behaves when correlating events. Each setting has a default value so customization is optional. Time window: Sets the maximum time between two incidents created time for them to be eligible for correlation. Issue priority: Overrides the default priority setting (inherit priority) to add higher or lower priority if the Incidents are correlated. Frequency: Modifies the minimum number of incidents that need to meet the rule logic for the decision to trigger. Similarity: If you're using similar to operators in your rule logic, you can choose from a list of algorithms and set its sensitivity. This will apply to all similar to operators in your decision. Similarity algorithms Here are technical details on the similarity algorithms we use: Levenshtein distance This measure is useful for comparing short strings with static schema and fixed length, like host names. Levenshtein distance is also known as edit distance. Details Description How it works The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the minimum number of single-character edits to get from one string to the other. Allowed edit operations are deletion, insertion, and substitution. The default similarity threshold for Applied Intelligence decisions is an edit distance of 3. You can change this in the Advanced mode of the decision builder. When to use it This measure is most useful for comparing relatively short strings with static schema and fixed length. Common applications include spell checkers, computational biology, and speech recognition. Examples number/bumble: 3 (number → bumber → bumblr → bumble) trying/lying: 2 (trying → rying → lying) strong/through: 4 (strong → htrong → throng → throug → through) Potential drawbacks Levenshtein distance is not normalized by default to take into account string lengths. Fuzzy score This metric is useful for comparing same-length strings where the same prefix would be a good indicator of correlation. Details Description How it works The fuzzy score algorithm works by allocating \"points\" for character matches between strings: One point for each matching character Two bonus points for subsequent matches The higher the fuzzy score, the greater the similarity between two strings. When to use it Fuzzy score is most useful for strings that have the same, and relatively short (ideally < 5 character), prefixes. A minimum guaranteed score would be (length(expected prefix) * 3) - 2. Examples Example: Decisions / dcsions d: 1 c: 1 i 1 s: 2 o: 1 n: 1 si: 2 io: 2 on: 2 ns: 2 = 15 points Potential drawbacks If the first character of the first string can't be found in the second string, no points are awarded. Fuzzy wuzzy ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings of similar length. Details Description How it works The fuzzy wuzzy family of similarity measures was developed by SeatGeek to help find tickets for the same event that have different labels across multiple platforms. The fuzzy wuzzy ratio for two strings is expressed as a percentage, where a higher number indicates a more similar string. It's based on the SequenceMatcher algorithm in Python's difflib. When to use it Fuzzy wuzzy ratio is effective for very short (eg. hostname) or very long (eg. event description) strings, especially in comparing strings of similar length. Potential drawbacks This algorithm is too sensitive to be used effectively for 3-10 word strings. One of the other modifications to fuzzy wuzzy (see below) may be a better choice. Fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings of different length. This modification to the fuzzy wuzzy algorithm helps address the effective length limitation. Details Description How it works With fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio, the shorter string is compared to each substring of the same length within the longer string. The score of the “best matching” substring is used to determine the fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio. When to use it Fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio is especially effective for the types of comparisons the basic fuzzy wuzzy algorithm fails at: 3-10 word strings where some significant substrings are likely to be overlapping. Examples For example, between the following strings: DevOps and SRE teams DevOps …”DevOps” (the shorter string, length = 6) would be compared to each substring with length 6 within “DevOps and SRE teams.” Since one of those substrings (“DevOps”) is a perfect match, the fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio for these two strings will be high. Potential drawbacks Where fuzzy wuzzy may be too conservative, fuzzy wuzzy partial match may be more liberal than expected with correlations. You can adjust the threshold in the decision builder according to your needs. Fuzzy wuzzy token set ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings where the information may not be in the same order, and of possible different lengths. It works best for sentences such as messages, descriptions, etc. Details Description How it works The token set ratio algorithm follows a few steps to compare strings: Tokenize each string (eg. “DevOps and SRE teams” → “DevOps” “and” “SRE” “teams”; “SRE team and DevOps engineers” → “SRE” “teams” “and” “DevOps” “engineers”) Combine intersecting tokens into a new string, leaving the remaining tokens. (eg. intersecting: ”DevOps”, “and”, “SRE”; remainder1: “teams”; remainder2: “team”, “engineers”) Alphabetize each token group (eg. “and, DevOps, SRE”, “teams”, engineers, team”) Compare the following pairs of strings: Intersection group Intersection group + remainder1 Intersection group + remainder2 The comparison from these pairs (“best matches”) is the fuzzy wuzzy token set ratio. When to use it This metric is helpful in cases where similar strings may have overlapping words but different construction - for example, event descriptions for different issues with the same resource. Potential drawbacks Where fuzzy wuzzy may be too conservative, fuzzy wuzzy token set match may be more liberal than expected with correlations. You can adjust the threshold in the decision builder according to your needs. Jaro-winkler distance This metric is useful for short strings where identical prefixes are a strong indication of correlation. Details Description How it works This metric uses a scale of 0-1 to indicate the similarity between two strings, where 0 is no similarity (0 matching characters between strings) and 1 is an exact match. Jaro-Winkler similarity takes into account: matching: two characters that are the same and in similar positions in the strings. transpositions: matching characters that are in different sequence order in the strings. prefix scale: the Jaro-Winkler distance is adjusted favorably if strings match from the beginning (a prefix is up to 4 characters). When to use it This metric is fairly tolerant of transpositions, but transpositions further apart in the string are less useful. A generally-safe number to use for Jaro-Winkler similarity in moderate to long strings is 0.9; you could use ~ 0.85 in cases where more leniency is okay (if you have other, more specific logic in the decision). Cosine distance This measure is most commonly used to compare large blocks of text (for example, incident descriptions) and provides an easy visualization of similarity. Details Description How it works For each text block you're comparing, a vector is calculated to represent the count of each unique word in the block. The cosine distance of the resulting vectors is their dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes. When to use it This measure is most useful to compare long blocks of text, specifically when the comparison is meant to consider the text as a whole, and not differences or misspellings in individual words. Examples It is not length of life, but depth of life. Depth of life does not depend on length. Copy Here are the word counts for these sentences: it 1 0 is 0 1 not 1 1 length 1 1 of 2 1 life 2 1 but 1 0 depth 1 1 does 0 1 depend 0 1 on 0 1 And here are those counts represented as a vector: [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] Copy The cosine distance of these vectors is about 0.9 (1 is the highest similarity). Potential drawbacks Cosine distance is less useful for situations where small character differences in words are insignificant. Also, cosine distance ignores word order in the text blocks. For more information on cosine distance implementation, see this detailed walkthrough. Hamming distance This measure is useful for shorter text with static schema, but it works only for same-length strings. Details Description When to use it Hamming distance requires the compared strings to be of equal length. This is a useful similarity metric for situations where the difference between two strings may be due to typos, or where you want to compare two attributes with known lengths. For example: Low Disk Space in application myapp in datacenter us01 If you wanted to be tolerant to datacenter changes, the hamming distance should be set to 4. An average use case for Hamming distance would be around 2-3. Examples A simpler version of \"edit distance\" metrics like Levenshtein distance, the Hamming distance between two strings is the number of characters in the string that don't match (in the same position). For example, in the strings below, the Hamming distance is 2: flowers / florets Copy Potential drawbacks In the example above, if the application name changes instead of the datacenter, a correlation would also be created. As the distance grows, the usefulness of Hamming Distance plummets. For this reason, for anything remotely more complicated than being tolerant to 1-2 character substitutions (or if the string lengths will not match), a different similarity measurement should be used. Jaccard distance This measure is useful for comparing large blocks of text, like descriptions or entire incidents. Details Description How it works The distance, denoted as a percentage (0 being completely similar; 1 being totally dissimilar) is calculated with the following formula: 1 - [(# of characters in both sets) / (# of characters in either set) * 100] Copy In other words, the Jaccard distance is the number of shared characters divided by the total number of characters (shared and un-shared). A Jaccard distance of 0.1 means that 10% or fewer characters between two incidents are different. When to use it Jaccard distance is very easy to interpret and especially useful in cases with large data sets. For example, in comparing the similarity between two entire incidents (as opposed to one attribute). Potential drawbacks It's less effective for small data sets or situations with missing data. Also, different permutations of the character set don't affect Jaccard distance, so care should be taken to prevent false positives. Regex operators When building a decision, available operators include: contains (regex): used in Step 1: Filter your data. regular expression match: used in Step 2: Contextual correlation. The decision builder follows the standards outlined in these documents for regular expressions. Regex in Step 1 In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute value (the data you’re evaluating) must be matched by the regular expression provided. Captured groups can be used but are not explicitly evaluated. For instance, if the attribute value is foobarbaz, these examples would meet the criteria and test as true: foo.* ^.*baz \\w+ Regex in Step 2 In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute values for incident 1 and incident 2 must be included in the match. Also, each captured group (expressions in ( ) parentheses) must exist in both values (incident 1 and incident 2 attributes), and have the same value: The number of captured groups must be equal for both incident attributes. Each group must be equal to the corresponding group between attribute values: the value of the first captured group in the incident 1 attribute value is equal to the value of the first captured group in the incident 2 attribute. For instance, if attribute value 1 is abc-123-xyz and attribute value 2 is abc-777-xyz, then (\\w+)-(?:\\w+)-(\\w+) would meet the criteria: The whole value is matched by the expression. The first and third captured groups have the same respective values. The second group is not captured using ?:, which allows the whole value to match but isn’t used in the capture group comparison. About flags No flags are enabled by default. Some useful flags to include in regular expressions in the decision builder are: CASE_INSENSITIVE: (?i) MULTILINE: (?m) DOTALL: (?s) See field detail for more notes on the function and implementation of each of these flags. Correlation assistant You can use the correlation assistant to more quickly analyze incidents, create decision logic, and test the logic with a simulation. To use the correlation assistant: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Overview, then click the Incidents tab. Check the boxes of incidents you'd like to correlate. Then, at the bottom of the incident list, click Correlate incidents. For best results for correlating incidents, select common attributes with a low frequency percentage. Learn more about using frequency. Click Simulate to see the likely effect of your new decision on the last week of your data. Click on examples of correlation pairs and determine of those correlations are desired. If you like what's been simulated, click Next, and then name and describe your decision. If the simulation result shows too many potential incidents, you may want to choose a different set of attributes and incidents for your decision and run another simulation. Learn more about simulation. Attribute analysis Here are explanations of the two types of attribute analysis displayed in the UI: Common attributes: This analysis simply highlights attributes and values that are the exact same between all selected incidents. Similar attributes: Similarity analysis uses the Levenshtein algorithm with a distance of 3 to find attributes whose values would be the same if 3 or less character changes are performed. Other details: Numerical values as well as single character values are filtered out of the results. Requires two incidents to be selected. Similarity analysis is not performed when 3 or more incidents are selected. To create the best decisions, we recommend choosing common attributes that have a lower frequency in your incidents. Here are tips for understanding how choosing low or high frequency attributes affects your decisions: Low frequency: As an example, an attribute with a 0% in the frequency column is likely a unique identifier or an attribute that only recently reported in your data in the last month. Choosing low frequency attributes may correlate few events. High frequency: On the other end, an attribute with 100% frequency would be one that is present on all your data. Choosing these attributes would correlate all of your events together. By default, the attributes are sorted by frequency with the least frequently reported attributes at the top. Click an attribute's frequency percentage to get more information about the distribution of values we've seen reported for that attribute in the last month. Tips on using simulation Using a set of incidents, the correlation assistant identifies common attributes among those incidents as well as attributes with similar values. Select attributes you believe are good indicators that events should correlate and then simulate the decision. Simulation will test the logic against the last week of your data and show you how many correlations would have happened, in addition to actual examples to inspect. If the simulation looks good, continue creating your real decision. If the simulation doesn't show examples of useful correlations, choose a different set of attributes, and run the simulation again. Here’s a breakdown of the decision preview information displayed when you create a simulation: Potential correlation rate: The percentage of tested incidents this decision would have affected. Total created incidents: The number of incidents tested by this decision. Total estimated correlated incidents: The estimated number of incidents this decision would have correlated. Incident examples: A list of incident pairs this decision would have correlated. You can click on these to see a side by side comparison of all attributes and values to help you determine if the correlation is desired or not. Run the simulation with different attributes as many times as you need until you see results you like. When you’re ready, follow the UI prompts to save your decision. Topology correlation What do we mean by “topology”? For New Relic's Applied Intelligence, topology is a representation of your service map: how the services and resources in your infrastructure relate to one another. When you create a custom decision, you can use our topology correlation, which finds relationships between incident sources to determine if incidents should correlate. Topology correlation is designed to improve the quality of your correlations and the speed at which they're found. Requirements Topology correlation is currently in limited release. Requirements: Given access to topology feature by a New Relic representative Limit of 10K vertices per New Relic organization per environment How does topology correlation work? In this service map, the hosts and apps are the vertices, and the lines showing their relationships are the edges. Topology correlation relies on two main concepts: Vertex: A vertex represents a monitored entity: it's the source from which your incident events are coming from, or describing a problematic symptom about. A vertex has attributes (key/value pairs) configured for it, like entity GUIDs or other IDs, which allow it be associated with incoming incident events. Edges: An edge is a connection between two vertices. Edges describe the relationship between vertices. To set up your topology, you'll use our NerdGraph API. But first, it may help to understand how topology is used to correlate incidents: First, New Relic gathers all relevant incidents. This includes incidents where decision-logic steps 1 and 2 are true, and that are also within the defined time window in advanced settings. In this example, all of the incidents in the dotted-line selection have met these requirements: they've gone through the decision logic in steps 1 and 2, and all contextual comparisons made in decision logic step 2 are true. Next, we attempt to associate each incident to a vertex in your topology graph using a vertex's defining attributes and the available attributes on the incident. Here's an example of the steps for associating incidents with the information in the topology graph. Next, the pairs of vertices which were associated with incidents are tested using the \"topologically dependent\" operator to determine if these vertices are connected to each other. This operator checks to see if there is any path in the graph that connect the two vertices within 5 hops. The incidents are then correlated and the issues are merged together. Add attributes to incident events Incidents are connected to vertices using a vertex's defining attributes (in the example topology under Topology explained, each vertex has a defining attribute \"CID\" with a unique value). Next, Applied Intelligence finds a vertex that matches the attribute. If the defining attribute you'd like to use on your vertices isn't already on your incident events there are a few ways to add it: Tag your entities in New Relic: By tagging your entities, those tags will enrich the incident events generated by Alerts. For example, if you've tagged your entities with CID and their corresponding unique values then you can have defining attributes on your vertex as follows: 'newrelic/tags/CID' : CID_VALUE Facet your data: Creating NRQL alert conditions with one or more facets defined will group your data by attribute. Also, incident events emitted will be enriched with those attributes and values. For incidents, faceted attributes follow the same format: newrelic/tags/ATTRIBUTE_NAME Create or view topology To set up your topology or view existing topology, see the NerdGraph topology tutorial.",

      "body": "You can manage your alert notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our NerdGraph API explorer. Tip See the NerdGraph introduction for help getting started with NerdGraph API explorer. Get notification channels The notificationChannels query allows you to paginate through all of your notification channels per account. You can also use the notificationChannel query to get a specific notification channel by its ID. Tip Note that certain secret fields (for example passwords or API keys) are obfuscated in the returned fields. List all notification channels for an account This example returns every field for every notification channel on the supplied account ID, up to the page limit of 200. Note how we use inline fragments to refer to the specific fields on the concrete types implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { config { integrationUrl } } ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { config { baseUrl basicAuth { password username } customHttpHeaders { name value } customPayloadBody customPayloadType } } ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { config { key routeKey } } ... on AlertsUserNotificationChannel { config { userId } } ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { config { apiKey } } ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { config { apiKey dataCenterRegion recipients tags teams } } ... on AlertsHipChatNotificationChannel { config { authToken baseUrl roomId } } ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { config { emails includeJson } } ... on AlertsCampfireNotificationChannel { config { room subdomain token } } } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Paginate through notification channels with cursor pagination If a given account's list of notification channels exceeds the 200 channel page limit, you can use the pagination cursor to retrieve additional pages. With cursor pagination, you continue to request additional pages using the nextCursor until that field returns empty in the response. An empty nextCursor signals that you have reached the end of the result set. Here's an example: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy The code above returns a set of results like this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"alerts\": { \"notificationChannels\": { \"channels\": [ { \"id\": \"250\", \"name\": \"Channel 1\", \"type\": \"SLACK\" }, { \"id\": \"713\", \"name\": \"Channel 2\", \"type\": \"WEBHOOK\" }, // ... +198 more notification channels in reality ], \"nextCursor\": \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\", \"totalCount\": 268 } } } } } } Copy In your next request, provide the cursor like so, updating each subsequent request to return the updated cursor, until the cursor is empty: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannels(cursor: \"Wh4LK9JYzfACVlNkyvf7Rg==:I5VbSEpgx3UWNA5AOVsUPv4=\") { channels { id name type } totalCount nextCursor } } } } } Copy Find a specific notification channel by id If you have a specific notification channel's ID, the API allows you to look it up directly. Note that because the specific channel is a concrete type implementing the AlertsNotificationChannel interface, you may need to specify certain fields using the ... on syntax for inline fragments. In this example, we are retrieving a Slack channel: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { notificationChannel(id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id name type ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { config { teamChannel url } } } } } } } Copy Create a notification channel In order to create an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to create (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Once a notification channel has been created, it can be associated with one or more alert policies. Once associated, those channels will receive notifications from those policies when conditions are violated. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only create a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Create an email notification channel An example create mutation for an email notification channel: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { emails: [\"email@example.com\"], includeJson: true, name: \"Some Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type config { emails

alertsNotificationChannelCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { integrationUrl: \"https://company.instance.xmatters.com/api/xm/v<version>/...\", name: \"xMatters notification channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type config { integrationUrl } } } error { description errorType } } } Copy Update a notification channel In order to update an alert notification channel, you need to know the specific type of notification channel you want to change (for example email, Slack, etc.), as well as the details necessary to configure it (which will depend on the channel type). Consistent with other GraphQL APIs, you can update a single field on the channel without knowing anything other than the channel's ID. Caution While you can query for any existing notification channel type, you can only update a subset of them. Specifically, the user channel type has no editable fields, and the Campfire and HipChat channel types are both deprecated. Update an email notification channel An example update mutation for an email notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { email: { name: \"Updated Name <email@example.com>\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsEmailNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an OpsGenie notification channel An example update mutation for an OpsGenie notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { opsGenie: { name: \"OpsGenie updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsOpsGenieNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a PagerDuty notification channel An example update mutation for a PagerDuty notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { pagerDuty: { name: \"PagerDuty updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsPagerDutyNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Slack notification channel An example update mutation for a Slack notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { slack: { name: \"Slack updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsSlackNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a VictorOps notification channel An example update mutation for a VictorOps notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { victorOps: { name: \"VictorOps updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsVictorOpsNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update a Webhook notification channel An example update mutation for a Webhook notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { webhook: { name: \"Webhook updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsWebhookNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Update an xMatters notification channel An example update mutation for an xMatters notification channel where we're updating only the name: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID, notificationChannel: { xMatters: { name: \"xMatters updated channel name\" } }) { notificationChannel { ... on AlertsXMattersNotificationChannel { id name type } } error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Delete a notification channel You can delete a notification channel with only the account ID and the channel ID. Note that deleting a channel dissociates it from all policies, meaning that no further notifications will be sent to that channel. mutation { alertsNotificationChannelDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID) { id error { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Associate channels to a policy Creating an alert notification channel is not enough: Once the channel has been created, it needs to be associated to one or more policies. Once associated to a policy, the channel can recieve alert notifications when conditions on that policy go into violation. In this example, we associate two channels with a policy: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsAddToPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Dissociate a channel from a policy In those instances where a notification channel has outlived its usefulness (for example, an email list that has been retired), the time has come to dissociate that channel from the policy (or policies) that are sending alert notifications to it. This API call leaves the channel itself intact, but removes it from the specified policy. In this example, we are removing two channels from a policy (leaving any others in place), and getting back confirmation that those two channel IDs have been removed: mutation { alertsNotificationChannelsRemoveFromPolicy(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, notificationChannelIds: [FIRST_CHANNEL_ID, SECOND_CHANNEL_ID], policyId: YOUR_POLICY_ID ) { notificationChannels { id } policyId errors { description errorType notificationChannelId } } } Copy Tip Removing an alert notification channel from a policy does not delete the policy because it might be used by other policies. On the other hand, deleting a channel will cause all associated channels to stop sending alert notifications to that channel.",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

Moving forward, we will be summarizing the most recent fixes and enhancements captured in this ongoing changelog. To stay up to date, subscribe to our Logs RSS feed. More to come soon! New public APIs In addition to the Logs UI for data partition management, you can now use our public API. Data partitions help you query more efficiently by scanning less unrelated data and returning results faster. To get started, see our NerdGraph tutorial. Parsing rules are also publicly accessible via the Log API. We already provide built-in parsing rulesets to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts. If you can't use log forwarders when collecting logs from CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services, you can use syslog protocols via a TCP endpoint. Bug fixes Fixed link to see logs from the Fluentd forwarder. Fixed crash when browsing after using a saved view. Fixed scenario where logs in context for distributed tracing wouldn't work. Changes Because of intermittent Fluent Bit build failures, SUSE will no longer be a supported platform for the infrastructure monitoring agent's log forwarder. We are working on adding SUSE support in the next six months. For tips on getting the most out of our changes to the Logs UI, check out this workflow to explore your logs data in New Relic One.",

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

Our goal is to give you the best log experience to advance observability and provide measurable impact to your business. Moving forward, we will be summarizing the most recent fixes and enhancements captured in this ongoing changelog. To stay up to date, subscribe to our Logs RSS feed. More to come soon! New public APIs Public APIs are now available for Parsing and Pipeline Configuration (e.g. drop filters). Documentation can be found within the NerdGraph API explorer, additional external documentation will be made available in September. Headerless HTTP Ingest Added support for Headerless HTTP log ingest. This enables Logs customers to send data to New Relic from sources that do not permit the customization of HTTP request headers (for example, Api-Key or X-License-Key).  This approach is most often used when forwarding logs from cloud-based platforms. More Data, More Power Increased maximum attribute value size. The Logs team recognizes that keeping all data from a log is extremely important, and so we are providing additional functionality to store more data and reduce the chances of truncation. Attributes can now store and display up to 128 kb, the first 4096 bytes of which are searchable. Added ARM support to our Helm-based Kubernetes integration. Bug Fixes Fixed several styling issues in Logs UI. Corrected typos on \"Add Your Data\" page.",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . .

      "body": "This approach adds a new authentication method to the customer-facing New Relic REST API (v2) that allows partners (and enterprise-scale customers that use the partnership structure to manage their multiple accounts) to use their partnership credentials to authorize all REST API (v2) calls. It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2).

Share configured API calls with colleagues by copy and pasting API Explorer's URLs. This helps you to quickly search for solutions and test your API calls before adding them to your own software components. Features New Relic's API Explorer includes an interactive user interface for your selected account. The API Explorer UI lists the types of API calls (Applications, Users, etc.) and their available functions, such as GET metric data, PUT (update) applications, DELETE applications, etc. As you type values for Parameters, they automatically appear in the Request so that you can test and verify your syntax before sending the request. The UI indicates required fields, field descriptions, their type (integer, float, Boolean, etc.), and their location (path, query, etc.). For information on API key requirements, see REST API keys. rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore: The New Relic API Explorer makes it easy to test and send requests for any API endpoint. After you select your account and your choice of functions for the type of API call (applications, browsers, users, etc.), the UI provides an interactive form to view requirements and test your parameter values. Differences from API version 1 This API Explorer applies only to the New Relic REST API version 2, which focuses on data in and data out of New Relic. Version 2 replaces New Relic's deprecated REST API version 1. Be aware there are some differences between version 2 and 1: Names for data may be different. Some cURL commands for v2 are different than v1. Tip The New Relic agents use different APIs and are not accessible via the API Explorer. For more help",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

Features New Relic's API Explorer includes an interactive user interface for your selected account. The API Explorer UI lists the types of API calls (Applications, Users, etc.) and their available functions, such as GET metric data, PUT (update) applications, DELETE applications, etc. As you type values for Parameters, they automatically appear in the Request so that you can test and verify your syntax before sending the request. The UI indicates required fields, field descriptions, their type (integer, float, Boolean, etc.), and their location (path, query, etc.). For information on API key requirements, see REST API keys. rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore: The New Relic API Explorer makes it easy to test and send requests for any API endpoint. After you select your account and your choice of functions for the type of API call (applications, browsers, users, etc.), the UI provides an interactive form to view requirements and test your parameter values. Differences from API version 1 This API Explorer applies only to the New Relic REST API version 2, which focuses on data in and data out of New Relic. Version 2 replaces New Relic's deprecated REST API version 1. Be aware there are some differences between version 2 and 1: Names for data may be different. Some cURL commands for v2 are different than v1. Tip The New Relic agents use different APIs and are not accessible via the API Explorer. For more help",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . .

For Java, you can also view the instance ID (JVM) from APM's Overview page. Agent Instance ID represents Go The Go program on the host reporting to the app name Java A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) .NET For New Relic's .NET Framework agent, this is the AppDomain Node.js A worker process PHP The daemon agent Ruby An individual Ruby worker process Python The master and worker processes You can retrieve summary metrics for the instance as well as specific metric timeslice values using the {INSTANCE_ID}. For details about available metrics, use the REST API Explorer Application Instance page. Instance ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $INSTANCE_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names.

These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names.

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI. You must also provide APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, and the monitoring enabled BOOLEAN (true or false) even if they are not being modified. curl -X PUT \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"application\": { \"name\": \"name\", \"settings\": { \"app_apdex_threshold\": APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"end_user_apdex_threshold\": BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"enable_real_user_monitoring\": BOOLEAN } } }' Copy This is the equivalent of using the APM UI to change the displayed app name.

A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values.

      "body": "The application name you see in the New Relic's user interface is a human-readable alias for the primary name assigned in your configuration settings. If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "The application name you see in the New Relic's user interface is a human-readable alias for the primary name assigned in your configuration settings. If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI. You must also provide APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, and the monitoring enabled BOOLEAN (true or false) even if they are not being modified. curl -X PUT \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"application\": { \"name\": \"name\", \"settings\": { \"app_apdex_threshold\": APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"end_user_apdex_threshold\": BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"enable_real_user_monitoring\": BOOLEAN } } }' Copy This is the equivalent of using the APM UI to change the displayed app name. This will not change the app identifier name under which your data will be collected. It will only change the app name that appears in the New Relic user interface.

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses.

To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed.

      "body": "The New Relic REST API (v2) paginates some responses, for performance reasons. This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same.

Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list.

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same.

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed.

API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls.

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . .

      "body": "The metric timeslice data presented on the Browser page load time chart on your application's Summary page will depend on your web app's configuration. Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. Use the following command to obtain this. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_network_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Page rendering time Page rendering time is a derived value. To calculate it, use this equation: \"Page rendering\" time = EndUser:average_fe_response_time - EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:average_fe_response_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_fe_response_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds.

DOM processing time The EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time is the time spent in the browser to parse and interpret the HTML. This is measured by the browser's DOM Content event. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds.

These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values.

      "body": "The metric timeslice data presented on the Browser page load time chart on your application's Summary page will depend on your web app's configuration. Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. Use the following command to obtain this. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_network_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Page rendering time Page rendering time is a derived value. To calculate it, use this equation: \"Page rendering\" time = EndUser:average_fe_response_time - EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:average_fe_response_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_fe_response_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. DOM processing time The EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time is the time spent in the browser to parse and interpret the HTML. This is measured by the browser's DOM Content event. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds. EndUser:call_count curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count' Copy Request queuing time The EndUser/RB:average_queue_time is the wait time between the web server and the application code. Large numbers indicate a busy application server. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_queue_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. The request queuing time is not included in the calculation of averages. New Relic includes it in this chart as a convenience.",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "The metric timeslice data presented on the Browser page load time chart on your application's Summary page will depend on your web app's configuration. Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet. Use the following command to obtain this. curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_network_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Page rendering time Page rendering time is a derived value. To calculate it, use this equation: \"Page rendering\" time = EndUser:average_fe_response_time - EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:average_fe_response_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=average_fe_response_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. DOM processing time The EndUser/RB:average_dom_content_load_time is the time spent in the browser to parse and interpret the HTML. This is measured by the browser's DOM Content event. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_dom_content_load_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds. EndUser:call_count curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=call_count' Copy Request queuing time The EndUser/RB:average_queue_time is the wait time between the web server and the application code. Large numbers indicate a busy application server. To obtain this data, use the following command: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser/RB&values[]=average_queue_time' Copy This time is returned in milliseconds. The request queuing time is not included in the calculation of averages. New Relic includes it in this chart as a convenience.",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

To use instrumentation supporting all SPA features, set up single page app monitoring via another method. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser applications > POST create. Use the following command: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"browser_application\": { \"name\": ${STRING} } }' Copy The API returns an array of data where the element is a browser application and the data associated with it: { \"browser_application\": { \"id\": \"integer\", \"name\": \"string\", \"browser_monitoring_key\": \"string\", \"loader_script\": \"string\" } Copy API (v2) output Description Browser app id (integer) This is the unique identification code for each app in New Relic One. App name (string) This is the app's name as it appears in the New Relic One. The browser_monitoring_key (string) This a unique key that is linked to (but is not the same as) the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your browser-monitored apps, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List. Use the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy You can use the results to verify the account or name, and to get a copy of the loader script for the app, if needed. View specific browser apps View by name: To view a specific browser app if you know its name, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${NAME} with your app's name in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"filter[name]=${NAME}\" Copy View by browser application ID: To view a specific browser app if you know its ID, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${ID} with your browser application ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=${ID}' Copy View multiple browser apps: To get information for multiple apps, separate the name or ID values with a comma in these commands; for example: -d 'filter[ids]=12345,23456' Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values.

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

      "body": "New Relic has several different APIs that use different API keys. This resource explains our keys, what they're used for, and how to access them. API key UI Most of the keys can be viewed and managed via the API keys UI page: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). If you're using NerdGraph, you can manage license keys and user keys from our GraphiQL explorer. Overview of keys If you're using a specific API, see the docs for that API to understand which keys are required and recommended. To learn about our APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Our keys can be broken down into two categories: Keys used for data ingest Keys used for querying and configuration Keys for data ingest There are many ways to get data into New Relic. Here are the API keys used for data ingest: License key: our primary ingest key, used for APM ingest, infrastructure monitoring ingest, and our ingest APIs and the integrations that use them. Browser key: used for browser monitoring ingest. Mobile app token: used for mobile monitoring ingest. Insights insert key: an older key that has been mostly deprecated, it has the same functionality as the license key. We recommend using the license key instead. Keys for querying and configuration Here are keys used for querying New Relic data or configuration of features: User key, also known as a \"personal API key\": used for NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) and for accessing REST API endpoints. REST API key: used for the REST API but we instead recommend using the user key because it has fewer restrictions. Insights query key: used with the Insights query API for querying New Relic data. We recommend using NerdGraph instead of this API. License key Our primary key used for data ingest is called the license key, also referenced in the UI and NerdGraph API as ingest - license. The license key is a 40-character hexadecimal string associated with a New Relic account. Each account in a New Relic organization has its own license key. When you first sign up for New Relic, that creates an organization with a single account, and that account has its own license key. If more accounts are added, each account will have its own license key. The types of data ingest the license key is used for include: APM agent data Infrastructure agent data Data sent via our core data ingest APIs (Metric API, Trace API, Event API, Log API), and the SDKs and integrations that use those APIs The license key is used for all data ingest except for browser monitoring data (which uses a browser key) and mobile monitoring data (which uses a mobile app token). Because the license key is used for data ingest, we recommend you treat your license key securely, like you would a password. This ensures no unwanted data is sent to your New Relic account. If your license key falls into the wrong hands, an attacker could send fake data to your account, which could trigger false alerts and contaminate your data so that detecting actual issues is more difficult. If you believe a license key has been exposed and has led to unwanted data, work with our Support team. View and manage license key To manage the license key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete the original license key that was created when an account was initially created. For that, contact New Relic support. You can also create additional license keys and manage them with our NerdGraph API. User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

User key New Relic user keys, sometimes referred to as \"personal API keys\", are required for using NerdGraph and for the REST API. A user key is tied to both a specific New Relic user and a specific account. Our APIs that use this key let a user make queries for any accounts that user has been granted access to. To view and manage the user key and other API keys in the UI: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). To manage this key via API, see Manage keys with NerdGraph. You can also get or generate a user key from the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Browser key One of the New Relic API keys that are used for data ingest is the browser key. The browser key allows the ingestion of data from New Relic browser monitoring. To view and manage this key: From the account dropdown, click API keys (here's a direct link to the API keys page). You can't manage or delete an original browser key that was created when your account was created. For that, contact New Relic support. Insights insert key Important This key is still in use but we highly recommend using the license key, which can be used for the same things and more. One of the New Relic API keys used for data ingest is the Insights insert key, also known as an \"insert key\"). Note that the license key is used for the same functionality and more, which is why we recommend the license key over this key. This key is used for the ingestion of data via our Event API, Log API, Metric API, and Trace API, or via tools that use those APIs. Tips on availability and access: Because these keys are associated with an account and not a specific user, anyone in the account with access to a key can use it. As a best practice for security purposes, we recommend you use different Insights insert keys for different applications or different data sources. To find and manage Insights insert keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights insert keys. REST API key Important We highly recommend using a user key instead, because that key has fewer restrictions. The REST API key is for using our REST APIs for Alerts, APM, browser, infrastructure alerts, as well as mobile monitoring REST APIs and the API Explorer. Things to consider: We recommend using our newer NerdGraph API over the REST API, if possible. Requires admin-level user permissions. If you don't have access to the REST API key or the REST API explorer, it might be due to lack of permissions. Talk to your New Relic account manager, or use a user key instead. Each New Relic account can have only one REST API key. To find and manage REST API keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click REST API key. Before you configure or delete an API key, ensure you are doing so for the correct account. Insights query key The Insights query key is used for our Insights query API: we now recommend using NerdGraph for querying New Relic data. To find and manage Insights query keys: From the account dropdown, click API keys (get a direct link to the API keys page). Then click Insights query keys. Admin key Important As of December 4, 2020, all existing admin keys have been migrated to be user keys. You don’t need to do anything for existing admin keys to remain active. They will be automatically accessible via the API keys UI, labeled as user keys, and granted identical permissions. You can manage them as you would any user key via the same workflow. All migrated admin keys will have a note that says “Migrated from an admin user key” in the key table, so you’ll be able to find them easily. Account ID Looking for the account ID? See Account ID.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2). It does not work with the following: Deployment API Infrastructure API for alerts Insights API Insights Dashboard API Partner API Plugin API Synthetics API",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names.

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . . Copy List instance IDs The instance ID meaning depends on the New Relic language agent being used. You can list this ID from the REST API. For Java, you can also view the instance ID (JVM) from APM's Overview page. Agent Instance ID represents Go The Go program on the host reporting to the app name Java A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) .NET For New Relic's .NET Framework agent, this is the AppDomain Node.js A worker process PHP The daemon agent Ruby An individual Ruby worker process Python The master and worker processes You can retrieve summary metrics for the instance as well as specific metric timeslice values using the {INSTANCE_ID}. For details about available metrics, use the REST API Explorer Application Instance page. Instance ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $INSTANCE_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values.

      "body": "New Relic's REST APIs let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the API Explorer to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses. Setup The REST API command structure follows this template: curl -X GET <URL> -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -d '<PAYLOAD>' Copy The GET command could also be a POST or DELETE, depending on the query intent. To understand the placeholders, keep reading. Tip Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The curl commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism. URL The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder <URL> with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template: https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy The $APPID specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request. If you have an EU region account, the URL is: api. eu .newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/metrics/data.json Copy Tip You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing .json with .xml. API key $API_KEY New Relic API calls require an API key. This may be one of several API keys: A user key: This is recommended. It's our latest key implementation and has fewer limitations than a REST API key. The user key is also used for our NerdGraph API. A REST API key: This is our older key implementation. For more information about it, see REST API key. If you use this key, the required header is X-Api-Key and not Api-Key. If you have a New Relic partnership account, you'll use a different key: see Partnership authentication. In our REST API examples, we borrow the API key placeholder $API_KEY from Unix shell programming. Be sure to replace that and other user-specific variables when forming calls. Query details (PAYLOAD) The < PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define: The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve The defined time range for retrieving metrics (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using summarize Examples See the following for example REST API use cases: APM examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from APM) Browser examples (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from browser monitoring) Infrastructure alert examples Plugin examples (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central) Alerts examples (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . . Copy List instance IDs The instance ID meaning depends on the New Relic language agent being used. You can list this ID from the REST API. For Java, you can also view the instance ID (JVM) from APM's Overview page. Agent Instance ID represents Go The Go program on the host reporting to the app name Java A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) .NET For New Relic's .NET Framework agent, this is the AppDomain Node.js A worker process PHP The daemon agent Ruby An individual Ruby worker process Python The master and worker processes You can retrieve summary metrics for the instance as well as specific metric timeslice values using the {INSTANCE_ID}. For details about available metrics, use the REST API Explorer Application Instance page. Instance ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $INSTANCE_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

In the URL, the number after the _i designator represents the Java JVM instance: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/applications/$APP_ID_i$INSTANCE_ID Copy REST API application list example The following example shows how to locate all the ID information for an application by using the APP_ID. If you have an EU account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=1441' <----<<<< {APP_ID} Copy The resulting example output is running on five servers.

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID.

Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 20. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for many of our more curated tools, such as our open source telemetry integrations and our Telemetry SDKs. Data type Description Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing plan) For organizations on our original pricing plan, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API. Plugins New Relic Plugins have been deprecated. For details, see Plugins EOL.",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and api test (SCRIPT_API) monitor types. These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order. Synthetics API attribute Definition apiVersion String: The version number. emails Array of strings: Email addresses for alert notifications with New Relic. frequency Integer: Number of minutes between checks. Valid values include 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, and 1440. id The UUID for the specific Synthetics monitor. locations Array of strings: Array of locations by full label. name String: The monitor's name. scriptLocations String: The name and hmac values for private locations using Verified Script Execution. scriptText String: The BASE64 encoded text for scripted monitors. slaThreshold Double: Value for the Synthetics SLA report, in seconds. status String: Valid values include ENABLED, MUTED, and DISABLED. type String: Type of monitor. Valid values include: SIMPLE (Ping) BROWSER SCRIPT_BROWSER SCRIPT_API uri String: The URI for SIMPLE and BROWSER monitor types; for example, http://my-site.com. Optional for SCRIPT_BROWSER and SCRIPT_API. userID Integer: The specific user ID. Specific monitor endpoint When making REST API calls for a specific monitor, include the monitor_uuid as part of the endpoint. The monitor_uuid is the GUID which is part of the URL. For example, a selected Synthetics monitor has this URL: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/nnnn/monitors/ab123-c456d-e78-90123-f45g Copy The monitor_uuid is the value that follows /monitors/.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 20. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values.

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit.

It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE '2021-03-07 07:00:00-0500' UNTIL '2021-03-08 07:00:00-0500' COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE 'today at midnight' UNTIL 'now' COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of entities. In this doc, you'll learn how we define entities, what you can do with them, and how you can create your own entities or groupings of entities. What's an entity? From a New Relic perspective, entity is purposefully a broad concept. An entity is anything that a) reports data to New Relic or that contains data that we have access to, and b) is something we've identified with a unique entity ID. For most entities, the ID is indicated by the attribute entityGuid. An entity can be any fundamental data-reporting component, like an application, a host, or a database service, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a workload (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity. Also very important is the relationships between entities. Our behind-the-scenes relationship-mapping helps us understand how entities are connected, how they affect each other. And this allows us to give you the power to configure how any data you're bringing in is related to existing entities, or how it's related to other entities. Our focus on entities and their relationships is important because our goal is to give you practical information about your business-important entities, and not give you an unhelpfully huge stream of data from a huge list of monitored things. With more insight at the entity level, you can better monitor and troubleshoot complex, modern systems. Find and explore entities and entity data Tip You can create new entity types for monitoring any data source. Learn more about entity synthesis. Some tips for finding and understanding entity data: To find an entity's entityGuid and entityName and other metadata: from any list of monitored entities in the New Relic Explorer, click an entity's icon, and click See metadata and tags. For most entities, its GUID is reported as the attribute entityGuid. For workloads, it's workloadGuid. You can run NRQL queries to find entities by their GUID. To see connections between entities, you have several options: When viewing an entity in the UI, use the Related entities UI. Service maps. Distributed tracing. Our NerdGraph API. To group entities together, see Group entities. Customize entity definitions and relationships. To learn technical details about entity types, see our GitHub repo. In an entity type's definition file, you'll see information like: The domain: for example, APM, or Infra. Its type: for example, Application or AWSECSCONTAINERINSTANCE. Default tags. The entityExpirationTime: how long data from that entity lasts in the UI, which is different from database data retention. Group and organize entities You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center. To group your entities, see: Tag entities. Create workloads, which allow you to group business-important sets of entities. Create entities and customize entity data Customize entity data with entity synthesis If you have telemetry from any source that's not supported by New Relic out of the box, you can propose a mapping for it. Once approved, any telemetry received by New Relic that matches your definition file will be synthesized into an entity. To learn more: For reserved attributes and how entity relationships are defined, keep reading this doc. For how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Reserved attributes for synthesized entities These attributes are meant to be synthesized from the telemetry we receive. Do not set them unless you're aware of the implications and consequences. Attribute Description entity.guid Generally, you should not set this attribute field on your telemetry data. New Relic may add this field to ingested data to store a unique identifier for the entity associated with the data point. If telemetry arrives with the entity.guid attribute already present, then New Relic will not change the value. However, it may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. One use case for passing this attribute is to associate ingested telemetry with an entity already created by New Relic. When the entity.guid attribute is sent, the value will override New Relic’s entity identification system (such as entity synthesis definitions) and instead will use the attribute as the data. entity.name This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data unless you're trying to override the entity name that would have been selected by New Relic’s entity identification system. While New Relic won't change the value if it's already present on the data, New Relic may add the attribute to your data. Therefore invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. If this field is present on ingested telemetry, its value will be used to name the entity associated with the data point. This name will be used instead of the name selected by New Relic’s entity identification system (for example, entity synthesis definitions). Note that many entities use the name as part of their identification, so changing this field may result in the generation of a new entity. entity.type This attribute shouldn't be put on ingested telemetry data except for certain legacy cases where it's required to distinguish entity types. Passing this field may interfere with entity detection, particularly if unrecognized values are sent in this field. While New Relic won't change the value if already present on the data, the field is not guaranteed to provide unambiguous filtering of telemetry at query-time. Existing entity definitions already have overlapping values, and we recommend avoiding entity.type in favor of other fields for filtering telemetry queries. This field is used by New Relic, meaning that invalid or unexpected values may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI, or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. To learn how to do the work of modifying existing entity types or creating new ones, see our GitHub repo on entity synthesis. Entity relationships Connections between entities are automatically created by New Relic based on what we can infer from your telemetry. For example, when two services that communicate using HTTP are instrumented with New Relic, we infer a \"calls/called-by\" relationship between them. When viewing a specific entity in either the New Relic Explorer, Navigator, or Lookout, you can see its Related entities in the entity's mini overview. This gives a visualization of the various entities connected directly to the current entity. You can quickly view important metrics for these related entities and navigate from one entity to another, through all the connected parts of your stack. Tip Learn more about how entities are related with our NerdGraph API. When relationships are not automatically detected, you can manually create them using the \"Add/edit related entities\" link in Related entities. Important Currently, you can only manually create calls/called-by relationships between service entities. Tip To manage manual relationships, you need to have modify and delete capabilities on entity relationships. If you don’t see the edit relationships button, contact your account admin. Which relationships are created? These are the relationships created between entities: Source: New Relic agent Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Application instrumented with a New Relic agent Relationships between applications monitored by New Relic agents are reported using the DurationByCaller metric. The callee reports the metric. For example, the metric DurationByCaller/Mobile/100/1234/HTTP/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent An application (caller) that calls a service (callee) monitored by New Relic creates a relationship that's reported by the caller using the ExternalApp metric. For example, the metric ExternalApp/dirac.vips.net/100#1234/all indicates that the callee is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. The metric is reported if the callee successfully responds to the caller. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS Service instrumented with a New Relic agent When a New Relic agent detects that a service (caller) calls another service (callee) instrumented by New Relic, the callee reports the metric ClientApplication. For example, the metric ClientApplication/100#1234/all indicates that the caller is APPLICATION 1234 for account 100. Service instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS A datastore instance When an application calls a datastore instance it creates a relationship reported with the DatastoreInstance metric. For example, the metric Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3/3306 indicates the datastore instance is vendor: MySQL, host: 172.16.16.3, port: 3306. This metric also supports the legacy datastore instance format Datastore/instance/MySQL/172.16.16.3:3306. Currently we cannot determine whether the datastore instance is instrumented by New Relic and has an entity associated to it. APM agent SERVES Browser agent This relationship is created when an APM agent injects the browser agent into a page. Workload entity CONTAINS Any entity When a workload is created or updated, relationships for each of the entities that belong to the workload are created. Because some workloads are “dynamic” (defined by tags), relationships are re-created every 5 minutes. This way entities can join or leave the workload. Source: Infrastructure Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Infrastructure host HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in one or more hosts, and the infra agent is running in those hosts. Infrastructure host HOSTS Container This relationship is created when containers are running in one or more hosts, and the host is instrumented with the infra agent. Source: Synthetics monitor Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Synthetics Monitor CALLS Browser agent This relationship is created when a synthetics monitor checks a page instrumented with the browser agent. Synthetics Monitor CALLS APM application Agent events that contain the attribute nr.syntheticsMonitorId have been described as synthetics monitors (the source) interacting with an APM application (the target). If the header exists and the APM application Id exists, a relationship is created between the monitor and the app. Source: Kubernetes Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? Cluster CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Deployment This relationship is created when a deployment is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS DaemonSet This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS StatefulSet This relationship is created when a StatefulSet is created in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Cluster CONTAINS Host This relationship is created when a host that's part of a cluster is instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Deployment CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a deployment creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. DaemonSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a DaemonSet is created a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. StatefulSet CONTAINS Pod This relationship is created when a StatefulSet creates a pod in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Pod CONTAINS Container This relationship is created when a pod creates a container in a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Host HOSTS Pod This relationship is created when a pod is running in a host that's part of a cluster instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration. Container HOSTS Application This relationship is created when an application is running in docker, and the hosts where docker is running are instrumented by the the infra agent. External services Relationship source Relationship type Relationship target Why is the relationship created? External service CALLS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with its name on the service.name attribute and the name of the service that initiates the call in the parent.service.name attribute. Application IS External service A relationship between an application and an external service is created so that users can navigate between them using the related entities component. Browser application instrumented with a New Relic agent CALLS External service A browser application reports an Ajax/HostTransaction metric when calling an external service (URL). Example metric: Ajax/HostTransaction/api.segment.io:443/CallbackTime' Cluster CONTAINS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the attribute k8s.cluster.name, the name of the cluster. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span. Pod HOSTS External service When the relationship is created, the external service reports a span with the following attributes: service.name: The name of the service. k8s.cluster.name: The name of the cluster. k8s.pod.name: The name of the pod that’s running the service. k8s.namespace.name: The namespace where the pod was created. The cluster must be instrumented with the New Relic Kubernetes integration and the cluster name set for the integration must match the one reported in the span.",

View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information.

View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics.

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated.

View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated.

View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query.

Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the Java agent troubleshooting example.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "The APM Summary page provides general information about the selected app, including web transactions and non-web transactions, Apdex score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or rpm), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and hosts. Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic explorer. View your app's summary page To reach the Summary page, go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app). Use the Explorer to access all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements. Alternatively, you can go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. View app performance Use the Summary page for a quick summary of your website's performance. Overview charts Some charts include links to APM pages where you can drill down into additional details. APM Summary chart Comments Transactions response time This stacked chart represents the response time of web transactions or non-web transactions in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for response time that represents the relationship between response time and total time. Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as Web external. For more information about these out-of-process services, use the Externals page. Apdex score This chart measures the performance of your app based on its Apdex T value during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question icon or the chart's End user and App server lines. The End user line charts the Apdex for your browser apps, and the App server line charts the Apdex for your APM apps. Throughput This chart illustrates the requests per minute for either web transactions or non-web transactions. To change the type of transaction, select the Transaction response time chart's dropdown arrow, then select Web or Non-web. Error rate This chart shows the number of errors that have occurred in the current time window. The tooltip that appears when you hover over the Error rate chart shows the combined throughput for both web and non-web transactions. To understand how error rate is calculated, see Application error rate example. Event markers Markers on the main Summary chart indicate events and changes to the app: Black vertical bar: Apdex settings have changed. Blue vertical bar: A deployment marker has been created or another event has occurred, such as a settings change for the app. Yellow or red area: This indicates alert thresholds have been violated. To view additional information, mouse over the marker. Drill-down details Use any of New Relic's standard page functions to drill down into detailed information. Here is a summary of additional options with the APM Summary page. If you want to... Do this... Change how data appears on the main chart Select the chart title's drop-down arrow, and then select your choice of view options, including histograms or percentiles if available. View threshold levels for your app's Apdex score Mouse over the Apdex score ? icon. For non-web transactions, the Apdex chart is blank because Apdex is not applicable to this class of apps. View trends in transaction time, Apdex, and throughput Select the Compare with yesterday and last week checkbox. The checkbox is only available when viewing the Web transaction response time chart with the time picker window Ending now. The checkbox is unavailable if you are viewing histograms, percentiles, or custom dates. View app performance since the last deployment From the time picker, select Performance since the last deployment. For detailed information about all deployments, select the Deployments page. View the Transactions page Select the Transactions table's heading on the APM Summary page. Or, to view details about a specific transaction (including operations, transaction traces, and key transactions), select its name. View the Databases or External services pages Click on a related time band in the Web transactions response time chart. View the Errors page Select the Error rate chart's title on the APM Summary page. You can also view the Errors page from one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Errors. Browser monitoring data If you install the browser agent via an APM agent, you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app. Once the browser agent is set up, the APM Summary page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding browser summary page. To view chart details with browser page load time, select the main chart's Browser link. To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's Browser link. Link app performance to resources The APM Summary page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their hosts, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory Tip CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see CPU usage is over 100%. Examine app performance within system context Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts: Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM Summary page for infrastructure. Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM Summary page for servers or JVMs. Examine details within infrastructure To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the infrastructure agent. To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure Compute page. When you click, the Compute data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Troubleshoot host link To troubleshoot the host link from the APM Summary page, use these tips: Host link from APM Summary Troubleshooting tips Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host. Follow standard procedures to install our infrastructure agent. The application is operating within a container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the container’s host. Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server. Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument: --uts=\"host\" Copy This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname. The application is running on a Windows container, and your infrastructure agent is installed on the Windows host. To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, enable process metrics in the infrastructure agent's configuration. Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname. Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings. The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname.

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute.
