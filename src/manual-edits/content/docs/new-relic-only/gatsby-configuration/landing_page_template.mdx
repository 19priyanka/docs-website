If you have a document that applies to multiple categories, you can create something that is akin to the dummy docs that we used to make in Drupal.

For example, if you wanted to link to the APM landing page from a unique link from another part of the navigation tree, youâ€™d do two things:

1. Update the `docs/apm/index.mdx` front matter with the URL you want to link to:

```
redirects:
  - /docs/unique-link
```

2. Add an entry in the navigation yaml file (for example, `agents.yml`):

```
title: APM Page with unique link
path: /docs/unique-link 
```
