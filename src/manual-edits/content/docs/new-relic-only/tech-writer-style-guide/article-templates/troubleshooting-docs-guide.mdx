To create a new troubleshooting doc: for best results, clone an existing troubleshooting doc that is close to the format you'd like to see for new doc.   

This guide provides additional details for how to complete the troubleshooting doc template. For an example doc that uses all three standard troubleshooting sections, see [Resolve .NET and SCOM conflicts](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/resolve-net-scom-conflicts).

## Problem

Generally, this is the **who**, **what**, **when**, and **where** of the troubleshooting doc.

* Provide a clear, concise description of the problem the user is trying to solve.
* Include steps for reproduction, symptoms, and other key points when applicable.
* Re-state the problem in different ways if needed, to ensure customers can find this doc via Google.

If the problem and cause are fairly short, include the [cause](#cause) text here.

## Solution

Generally, this is the **how** of the troubleshooting doc. Provide an ordered list of steps to guide users through the solution.

If the issue you are documenting is more of a known issue (FYI in nature), or if it doesn't solve the issue:

* Incorporate the information into other relevant docs. Do not refer to it as a known issue.

  OR
* Create a troubleshooting doc that describes the problem and cause. Do not include a solution. Also, include any statements promising that the issue will be fixed in a future release.

## Cause

Generally, this is the **why** of the troubleshooting doc, and is optional. The **Cause** section is particularly useful when the product works in an unintuitive way.

Provide background information or context that gives the user additional insight into the problem. If the problem and the cause text are both fairly short, you can include the cause in the [**Problem** section.](#problem)
