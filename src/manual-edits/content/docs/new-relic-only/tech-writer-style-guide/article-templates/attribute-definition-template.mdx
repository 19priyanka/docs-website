Use this template to document an [attribute](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) to be added in the [New Relic data dictionary](https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary).

## Add an attribute [#create]

To add an attribute to the data dictionary: First look for already-existing attribute name in the dictionary. If it has the same name and same definition, you can simply add another data type to that existing attribute. Otherwise, create a new entry. 

For information about the various fields available and how to fill them out, see below. 

## Attribute name

**Required.** Enter the name of the attribute, using the exact capitalization in your original source. Individual attributes are associated with one or more events.

## Short description [#short-desc]

**Required.** Write a brief description of the data returned for this attribute. Short descriptions appear in the New Relic Insights when users mouse over the UI.

A good short description is preferably one or two lines long and accurately describes the data. Additional details can be added to the [long description](#long-desc).

## Long description [#long-desc]

Sometimes an attribute needs more context or details, such as OS dependencies, than what is provided in the short description. You can include the detailed information in the long description.

Then, when an attribute includes a long description, the data dictionary will add a `read more` link to the attribute's short description in the UI. When users click the link, the attribute doc will open so that they can read the long description.

## New Relic data types [#data-type]

**Required.** Every attribute in the data dictionary must be associated with at least one data type. Attributes are commonly used by more than one data type.
