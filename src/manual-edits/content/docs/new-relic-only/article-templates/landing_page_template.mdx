Landing pages are a specialized type of page that serve as the starting pages for various New Relic products. For example, you'll see landing pages for Application monitoring (APM) and Browser monitoring. 

<Tip>
  
  This landing page information does not apply to the docs home page.
  
</Tip>


If you need to create a new landing page, you can either copy an existing landing page, or you can modify the APM landing page shown below. Let's look at the sections you need for each landing page.

## Front matter

When you insert the front matter, be sure to designate the `type` as `landingPage`. Here's an example:

```
---
title: New Relic APM
type: landingPage
tags:
  - APM
translate:
  - jp
redirects:
  - /docs/apm/new-relic-apm-0
  - /docs/apm/new-relic-apm-landing-page
---
```

## Introduction

After you insert the front matter, insert the introduction, which typically just includes text and an image. If you need help with inserting images, see the example at the bottom.

## Tiles

Tiles are a series of boxes that contain the main subject areas for your product. You should just list these in order you want them to appear, and the cascading style sheet will render them across the page.

Here's an example of a tile: 

```
<LandingPageTileGrid>
  <LandingPageTile
    title="Insert your box title here."
    icon="fe-followed-by-the-icon-name"
  >

Insert tile content here...

</LandingPageTile>
```
For each tile, do the following:

* Insert a value for `title` that explains the purpose of the category.
* Insert a value for `icon` by prefixing one of the [Feather Icons](https://github.com/newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/tree/develop/packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic#available-icons) with `fe-` so it is recognized (for example, fe-alert-triangle).
* Between the `LandingPageTile` tags, insert text, such as a bullet list with links to product documentation.

## Button for viewing all docs in the category

After your tiles, you should have a single button offers to take users to all the documentation for that category. 

Here's an example:

```
<ButtonLink
  role="button"
  to="/docs/apm/table-of-contents"
  variant="normal"
>
  View all APM docs
</ButtonLink>
```

## Code sample

Here is the APM landing page you could modify to suit your needs:

```
---
title: New Relic APM
type: landingPage
tags:
  - APM
translate:
  - jp
redirects:
  - /docs/apm/new-relic-apm-0
  - /docs/apm/new-relic-apm-landing-page
---

Your Dev/Ops teams need to know why a performance blocker comes from the application itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something else entirely unexpected. You also need to optimize app performance wherever possible.

With New Relic's [Application Performance Monitoring (APM)](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm), you have real-time and trending data about performance for your [web apps](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm) and [processes (non-web apps)](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions). In addition, with [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one), you can correlate your app's related services, alerts, logs, your infrastructure, and your corresponding mobile app experience.

Don't just monitor your data to get details about what's happening at a particular point of time. Instead, use the collective power of New Relic One to understand what to do with your detailed data, across your entire stack.

Starting from your APM summary page in New Relic One, dive into the wealth of charts showing current and historical trends about your app's performance. Then query, visualize, and act on that data in New Relic One.

<LandingPageTileGrid>

    * Track down abnormal app performance with [transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces), [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), and [slow database queries](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/databases-slow-queries-page).
    * Find and fix errors with [error analytics](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/introduction-error-analytics) tools and profiles of [error trends](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-profiles-troubleshoot-trends).
