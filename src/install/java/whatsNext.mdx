#### See your app data in the UI

Look for your app name on the [APM Summary page](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?filters=%28domain%20IN%20%28%27APM%27%2C%20%27EXT%27%29%20AND%20type%20IN%20%28%27APPLICATION%27%2C%20%27SERVICE%27%29%29&state=f1dfd001-1723-431e-5412-33488d36fce8) (it can take a few minutes). 

#### Read more about APM

For example, read about the [Summary page](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data/), the [JVM app server metrics page](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/features/jvms-page-java-view-app-server-metrics-jmx/), and the [Transactions page](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/transactions-page-find-specific-performance-problems).
