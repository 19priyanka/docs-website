When using the config file we recommend:

<ul>
  <li>
    change the default `newrelic.yml` file permissions to read/write only for
    the owner of the application server process.
  </li>
  <li>make sure `newrelic.yml` is part of your backup routine.</li>
  <li>
    use the [New Relic Diagnostics
    CLI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/)
    to validate your settings, either before or after you deploy.
  </li>
</ul>
