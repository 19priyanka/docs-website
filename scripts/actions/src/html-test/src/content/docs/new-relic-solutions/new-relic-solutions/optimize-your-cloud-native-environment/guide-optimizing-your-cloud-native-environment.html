<p>As software organizations modernize, they’re adopting the cloud at rapid pace. The cloud offers many advantages, but it can be increasingly difficult to stay ahead of the curve: Providers are constantly unveiling new technologies and management approaches; modern, distributed environments are becoming increasingly complex; and proper scaling requires a full understanding of your infrastructure and customer experience—not to mention, it’s costly.</p>
<p>Whether you were “born in the cloud” or have recently <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/plan-your-cloud-adoption-strategy/guide-planning-your-cloud-adoption-strategy">migrated your on-premise applications to the cloud</a>, you still have plenty of work to do to perfect your cloud native experience. The solutions in these tutorials provide best practices for using New Relic to optimize your cloud environment.</p>
<p>Using New Relic, you can more easily monitor your entire system, from your infrastructure to your applications to your end-user experience, and more confidently transition to a microservices architecture or <a href="#adopt">adopt new technologies</a> like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>. New Relic also helps you <a href="#experimentation">promote a culture of experimentation</a> in your complex, distributed environments, and <a href="scale">extends these benefits across your entire platform</a> while justifying your IT costs. In other words, New Relic helps you measure your cloud native journey at every step of the way.</p>
<h2>Adopt new technologies easily [#adopt]</h2>
