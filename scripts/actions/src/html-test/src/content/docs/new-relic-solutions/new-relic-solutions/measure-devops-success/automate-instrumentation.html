<p>Replacing manual instrumentation with automated setup benefits you in many ways. Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errorsâ€”and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows.</p>
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<p>Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/measure-devops-success/measure-code-pipelines">Measure code pipeline</a> tutorial.</p>
<h2>1. Make instrumentation part of every build [#make-instrumentation-build]</h2>
<p>Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a> can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently.</p>

  <p>Read this <a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/best-practices-automating-monitoring/">Best Practices post</a> for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline</p>

<p>Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/terraform-provider-newrelic">New Relic Terraform Provider,</a> you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a <a href="/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards">dashboard</a> when you start up a new service.</p>

<h2>2. Take advantage of CLI tools [#cli-tools]</h2>
<p>Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli">New Relic CLI</a> lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli">New Relic Lambda CLI</a> installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the <a href="https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/nr1-cli">NR-1 CLI</a> to build and share your own New Relic applications.</p>
<h2>3. Leverage the power of APIs [#leverage-apis]</h2>
<p>Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apis/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer">New Relic API Explorer</a> can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls.</p>
<p>The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/rest-api-alerts/new-relic-alerts-rest-api/rest-api-calls-new-relic-alerts">APIs to set up alert conditions</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api">APIs to define synthetic monitors</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-api/manage-dashboards/insights-dashboard-api">APIs to create dashboards</a></li>
</ul>
