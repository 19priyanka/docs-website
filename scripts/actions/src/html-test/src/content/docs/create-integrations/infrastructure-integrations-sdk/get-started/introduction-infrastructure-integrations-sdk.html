<p>There are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>General telemetry (metrics, traces) solutions: Use our <a href="/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic">Telemetry SDKs</a>.</li>
  <li>Build a custom <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application">New Relic One application</a> that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality.</li>
  <li>If you have New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration">Flex integration tool</a> (recommended) or use our Integrations SDK to build a complete Infrastructure <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations">on-host integration</a>.</li>
</ul>

  <p>New Relic is transitioning to rely on open source standards like Prometheus for future on-host integrations. Though the infrastructure SDK is the foundation of that transition, some of the tutorials and tools around this SDK might not be up-to-date with the latest developments.</p>

<h2>What is the Integrations SDK? [#what-is-it]</h2>
<p>Our Infrastructure Integrations SDK lets you build an <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations">on-host integration</a> that reports custom data from your hosts or services. That data can then be found in New Relic Infrastructure and can be used to create custom queries and charts.</p>
<h2>What data can you report with an on-host integration? [#data-types]</h2>
<p>When you build an integration using the Integrations SDK, you assign the <strong>entities</strong> that report data. In New Relic terms, <strong>entity</strong> is a purposefully ambiguous term meaning something that reports data to New Relic (for example: a local host, a load balancer, or a database).</p>
<p>A single integration can report data from multiple entities, which gives you the ability to report data from more than one service or host instance.</p>
<p>There are three types of data an entity can generate:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Metrics</strong>: Metric data is used for numerical measurement data. Examples: how many requests are in a queue, or the number of hits on a database per minute. Metric data from a custom integration can be queried and used to create dashboards.</li>
  <li><strong>Inventory</strong>: Live system state and configuration information. This data will show up on the Infrastructure <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure">Inventory UI page</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Events</strong>: Events are used to record important activities on a system. Examples: a service starting or a new table being created. Event data will be shown in the Infrastructure <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-events-page-live-feed-every-config-change">Events UI page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create a custom integration [#create]</h2>
<p>To create an integration using the Integrations SDK, use these resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>See <a href="/docs/infrastructure/integrations-sdk/get-started/infrastructure-integration-building-resources">the Go language build tools and tutorial</a>. The tutorial walks you through creating a Redis integration in Go. (Note: Go is not required; it's just the language for which we provide additional build tools. For more information, see <a href="/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-infrastructure-integrations-sdk">Integrations SDK requirements</a>.)</li>
  <li>See the <a href="/docs/infrastructure/integrations-sdk/get-started/create-activate-infrastructure-integration">integration file structure</a> documentation, which describes the files required to create an integration.</li>
</ul>
