<p>The UI for the New Relic Android app provides functionality similar to the <a href="/docs/site/standard-dashboard-features">standard user interface</a>, with customized details for mobile users.</p>
<h2>Pages [#dashboard]</h2>
<p>
  <img src="./images/deployment-markers_nexus.jpg" alt="New Relic Android app dashboard" title="New Relic Android app dashboard"> To view details of your New Relic apps, hosts, Synthetics monitors, Alerts, plugins, and key transactions, select a product from the main menu.
</p>
<p>The New Relic Android app includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New Relic APM metrics, both real-time and <a href="#time">historical</a> data, including health maps. And, select the transaction 
    <img src="./images/icon-txn-list-ios.png" alt="icon-txn-list-ios" title="icon-txn-list-ios"> icon for detailed transaction metrics, or an <strong>Overview Charts</strong> to view summary charts of your top five transactions.
  </li>
  <li>New Relic Infrastructure utilization.</li>
  <li>New Relic Plugins, including a list of their components or instances, and their charts and current values from the plugin's <a href="/docs/plugins/viewing-the-plugin-summary">Summary</a>.</li>
  <li>New Relic Mobile, including <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/mobile-app-dashboards/mobile-apps-crash-dashboard">crash reports</a>, network errors, API calls, and active user count.</li>

    <div data-component="Icon" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJuYW1lIiwidmFsdWUiOiJmZS1maWx0ZXIifV0="></div>icon to filter by <a href="/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/labels-categories-organize-your-apps-servers">labels and categories</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Event notifications, including <a href="/docs/mobile-apps/new-relic-ios-app/features/ios-alerting">mobile alerts</a> wherever you are, plus <a href="/docs/applications-menu/deployments-dashboard">deployment notifications</a> and <a href="/docs/site/public-and-private-notes">notes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> New Relic's Android app does not have the full feature set of the New Relic web interface. For more detailed analysis, sign in to your New Relic account with a web browser.</p>
<h2>Time range [#time]</h2>
<p>When viewing an application or host, you can change the visible time frame by using the time picker icon in the top right of the page (the <strong>7D</strong> in the screenshot). This feature is similar to the standard New Relic <a href="/docs/site/timepicker-setting-time-periods-to-view-data">time picker</a>. Features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scrub the New Relic charts to move back and forth in the timeline.</li>
  <li>Select the time picker to choose a time range that ends now (from 30 minutes to 90 days ago).</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Relic Synthetics [#synthetics]</h2>
<p>
  <img src="./images/synthetics_nexus.jpg" alt="Android app synthetics" title="Android app synthetics">
</p>
<p>You can use the Android app to view your <a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/new-relic-synthetics">New Relic Synthetics</a> data, including charts of your monitor's availability, load times, and load sizes. Select the caret
  <div data-component="Icon" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJuYW1lIiwidmFsdWUiOiJmZS1jaGV2cm9uLWRvd24ifV0="></div>icon to view more detailed charts. You can mute or disable your monitor, and view details of any recent errors. For scripted monitors, you can view and search the script log.
</p>
<h2>Alerts</h2>
<p>When you log in to your New Relic account from the Android app, your device is automatically associated with your <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts#user">user channel</a>. Then, you can <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts#mobile-push">add your user channel to your target policy</a> to receive alerts. For Android alerts, notifications appear on your lock screen and can be viewed by tapping the alert.</p>
<p>You can select any alert to view error details or acknowledge the alert. New Relic also sends a push notification when a colleague acknowledges an open event. Then, New Relic sends a final, closing notification when all <strong>Critical</strong> events end.</p>
<h2>Mobile apps</h2>
<p>If you have a mobile application and have installed <a href="/docs/mobile-apps/new-relic-mobile">New Relic Mobile</a>, you can monitor its performance directly from your Android device. New Relic Mobile monitoring includes network errors, API calls, and number of active users. You can also view detailed individual crash reports for a deeper understanding of a particular crash incident.</p>
