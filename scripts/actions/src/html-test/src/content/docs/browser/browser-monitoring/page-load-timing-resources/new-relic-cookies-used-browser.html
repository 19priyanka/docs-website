<h2>Data privacy and legal compliance [#gdpr]</h2>
<p>The default Browser agent configuration does not retain any personal data as defined by common privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). New Relic has taken steps to enable our customers who elect to process personal data in our products to do so in accordance with applicable privacy laws. Use the additional information below to help enable your compliance with such laws:</p>

        <p>IP addresses</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>New Relic briefly collects and leverages the IP address from the end-user as part of the data collection process. The IP is captured when a connection is made between the end user's browser and the <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary">New Relic data collector</a>. The IP address is included in the web request, much like a caller ID. New Relic uses the IP, much like you see a phone number when somebody calls you.</p>
        <p>The IP address is used as a lookup value that maps to additional details, allowing New Relic customers to diagnose performance issues.</p>
        <p>IP address lookup values include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/pageview/countrycode"><code>countryCode</code></a></p>
          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            <p><code>asn (Autonomous System Number)</code></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><code>asnOrganization (ISP/Business/Institution)</code></p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/pageview/asnlongitude"><code>asnLongitude</code></a></p>
            <p>The mapping process for the IP address lookup value is typically complete within minutes, but in some extreme cases may take up to 24 hours to process. Once the mapping process is complete, New Relic no longer retains the IP address.</p>

        <p>Default cookies</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>The Browser monitoring agent sets cookies by default. Cookies are placed by the Browser agent and the New Relic collector. The New Relic collector places a cookie when the Browser agent makes a connection and transmits data.</p>
        <p>A cookie consent manager that uses a conditional script loader that only loads tags/snippets when a visitor agrees to a specific type of cookies can be used. By choosing this option there is a risk that page performance will not be captured until the visitor has agreed and the Browser agent is running.</p>
        <p>With the release of <a href="/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes/browser-agent-v1169">Browser agent v1169</a>, you can turn off cookie collection (<a href="#jsessionid"><code>JSESSIONID</code></a> and <a href="#nreum"><code>NREUM</code></a>) for your Browser app by using the <strong>Application settings</strong> page in the New Relic UI. Once this configuration value is set to false (OFF), you will no longer see the session information in your event data.</p>
        <p>By default, the value is set to true (ON) for all existing Browser apps as well as newly created ones. For more information, see our documentation about <a href="/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/page-load-timing-resources/cookie-collection-session-tracking">cookie collection and session tracking</a>.</p>

        <p>Personal data through custom Browser configuration</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>New Relic offers the option to manually configure your agent through the <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api">Browser monitoring API</a>. This could be used to capture personal data, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Terms of Service with New Relic. (For example, no credit card numbers or sensitive categories of personal data, which are contractually prohibited.) New Relic responds to the instructions specified by the agents, including collecting personal data that may be custom configured.</p>
        <p>If you (as the data controller) receive a request from one of your own customers and determine that personal data sent to New Relic for processing must be deleted, see <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/new-relic-personal-data-requests">New Relic personal data requests</a>.</p>

<h2>JSESSIONID</h2>
<p>The JSESSIONID cookie is used to store a <strong>session identifier</strong> so that New Relic can monitor session counts for an application. The cookie value is generated by Jetty.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h2>NREUM</h2>
<p>This cookie is only created in browsers that do not support the <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-apis/navigation-timing-api">Navigation Timing API</a>. When a browser supports the Navigation Timing API, a native interface can be used to determine navigation start time.</p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox versions 7 or higher support the Navigation Timing API. However, a bug exists in Firefox's early implementations of the Navigation Timing API that Browser monitoring works around by using this cookie.</p>

<h2>NRAGENT</h2>
<p>The NRAGENT cookie is set only if you use Browser agent <a href="/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes">version</a> v443 or lower. It is created when a token is handed out to an end user by the New Relic collector.</p>
<p>End-user metrics are communicated to New Relic collectors via a JSONP request from the browser (script retrieval). The returned JavaScript contains a call to set the token identifier which is written to the cookie on the next navigation (when the page unloads). This achieves a cross-domain communication between the New Relic collector and the New Relic agent.</p>
<p>This cookie is used to communicate between the New Relic collector aggregating end user metrics and the agent(s) running in the associated web application. A token identifies and correlates application <a href="/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#tier">tier</a> transaction traces with corresponding browser traces.</p>
