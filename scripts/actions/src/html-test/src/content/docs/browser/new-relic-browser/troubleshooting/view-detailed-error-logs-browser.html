<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>You want to use your browser's console to view detailed error messages environment, but when Browser monitoring is active, your browser's console does not display detailed error traces.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Browser monitoring must capture and re-throw errors in order to record them, but some browser versions do not display stack traces for re-thrown errors. To solve this problem, enable Browser's development mode in your local browser.</p>
<p><a href="/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes">Browser monitoring agent versions 593 or higher</a> include a workaround for this behavior, which can be enabled in the console. The following procedure is for Google Chrome, but you can adapt it for other browsers.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In Chrome, select the menu icon, then select <strong>More tools > JavaScript Console</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the JavaScript console, set the following value for <code>nr_flags</code> in local storage:</p>
    <pre><code>localStorage.setItem('__nr_flags', 'dev')
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Refresh the page where you want to see your JavaScript errors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To confirm development mode is active, check the console's Browser agent logs for the message <code>NR AGENT IN DEVELOPMENT MODE</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate the site, then trigger the errors that you want to track.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>To disable development mode, run the following command in the console:</p>
<pre><code>localStorage.removeItem('__nr_flags')
</code></pre>
