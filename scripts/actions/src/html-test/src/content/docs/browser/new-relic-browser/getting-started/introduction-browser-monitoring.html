<p>Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it?</li>
  <li>Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else?</li>
</ul>
<h2>More than Real User Monitoring (RUM) [#life-cycle-monitoring]</h2>
<p>Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one">New Relic One</a> provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>With Browser Monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app.</p>
<p>But Browser goes far beyond the initial page load to measure <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process">full page life cycle data</a>. For example, our Browser UI shows you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual performance data, such as by <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/additional-standard-features/page-views-insights-your-sites-popularity">page view popularity</a> and <a href="/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction">user satisfaction (Apdex)</a> scores</li>
  <li><a href="#pageviewtiming">Perceived performance data</a> that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/js-errors-dashboard-examining-errors-over-time">JavaScript error analytics</a>, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/session-traces-exploring-webpages-life-cycle">Session performance</a> with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/ajax-dashboard-identifying-time-consuming-calls">AJAX requests</a> indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage</li>
  <li>Hash-based route changes in apps with <a href="#spa">single-page application (SPA)</a> architectures</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack.</p>
<h2>Examine user perceptions [#pageviewtiming]</h2>
<p>Real user data gives insights into actual page performance, but you also need to look into your users' perception of your site's performance. Pages can load content in many different ways, and users control when they interact with that content. This is why some <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/pageviewtiming-async-or-dynamic-page-details">user-centric performance metrics</a> happen outside the standard window onload (page load time) in the Browser agent.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/attribute-dictionary/pageview?attribute_name=&#x26;events_tids%5B%5D=10061"><code>PageViewTiming</code> event</a> provides a more real-time delivery mechanism that does not have a dependency on any other event. Additional metrics include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First paint, first contentful paint, and largest contentful paint</li>
  <li>First input delay</li>
  <li>First interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>This helps you understand how users experience your site, both from visual and responsiveness standpoints.</p>
<h2>Improve interactive app performance [#spa]</h2>
<p>Our <a href="/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/browser-ui/view-spa-data-new-relic-browser">single-page app (SPA)</a> monitoring automatically tracks route changes, initial page loads, and synchronous and asynchronous activity during browser interactions. You can also use the <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api">Browser agent and SPA API</a> to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser.</p>
<p>If you are a developer, SPA monitoring can help you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps.</li>
  <li>Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing.</li>
  <li>Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load.</li>
  <li>Query and visualize the data to assist with business decisions.</li>
  <li>Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Correlate front-end and back-end problems [#full-stack]</h2>
<p>With New Relic One, you can instrument any type of data you need, such as <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types">metrics, events, logs, and traces</a>. This helps you find actionable data about your end users' experience across the stack. For example:</p>

      <div>
