<p>Pages can be cached in the browser or on a server. A cached page will contain stale (previously generated) application and queue times.</p>

<h2>Detecting cached pages [#browser-traces]</h2>
<p>Browser monitoring detects cached pages by comparing the total back-end time against app and queue time. When the sum of app and queue time is greater than the total back-end time, Browser monitoring assumes the page was cached and aggregates the request with app and queue times as 0.</p>
<p>Here are some additional tips for cached pages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Java</strong>: Flush the app serverâ€™s "work" cache. This forces the app server to recompile.</li>
  <li><strong>.NET</strong>: Make sure your <strong>asp.net</strong> cache directory is clean by using the command <code>flush_dotnet_temp.cmd</code>. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Node.js</strong>: By default, Node.js does not cache pages.</li>
  <li><strong>PHP</strong>: If you have a CDN cache your dynamic pages, make sure the cache contains the page load timing instrumentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Python</strong>: Restart your app.</li>
  <li><strong>Ruby</strong>: Look at the header information for automatic vs. manual instrumentation. For example, if you want to ignore specific webpages, you must disable automatic browser monitoring from the <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-settings">user interface</a>, and then manually instrument the webpages that you do want to be tagged.</li>
</ul>
