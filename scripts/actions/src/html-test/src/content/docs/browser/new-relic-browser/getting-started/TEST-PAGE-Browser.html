  <p>Hello! This page is only here for usability testing. It repeats some real page content, but it also contains some obvious, intentional errors. Thanks for bearing with us.</p>
</div>
<p>Your end-user experience depends on your entire technology stack. You need to quickly understand what's causing a customer complaint or issue.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Did the problem come from your infrastructure, your application, or the browsers that ultimately render it?</li>
  <li>Is it the result of a problematic internet provider, a problem in your own data center with failing CPU or memory, or something else?</li>
</ul>
<h2>More than Real User Monitoring (RUM)</h2>
<p>Many websites contain dynamic content that is loaded after the initial page has finished loading, and complex JavaScript code increases the need for error reporting. Browser monitoring in <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one">New Relic One</a> provides a Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks.</p>

</p>
<p>With Browser Monitoring in New Relic One, you see actionable data about your end users' experience with your app.</p>
<p>But Browser goes far beyond the initial page load to measure <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process">full page life cycle data</a>. For example, our Browser UI shows you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual performance data, such as by <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/additional-standard-features/page-views-insights-your-sites-popularity">page view popularity</a> and <a href="/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction">user satisfaction (Apdex)</a> scores</li>
  <li><a href="#pageviewtiming">Perceived performance data</a> that measures how quickly your async or dynamic visuals and interactive page contents display</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/js-errors-dashboard-examining-errors-over-time">JavaScript error analytics</a>, stack traces, and line-of-code visibility, to show you the end-user steps leading up to an error itself</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/session-traces-exploring-webpages-life-cycle">Session performance</a> with a detailed timeline and heat map of the load and interaction events during a webpage's full life cycle</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/ajax-dashboard-identifying-time-consuming-calls">AJAX requests</a> indicating problems with timing, end points, and specific locations in the webpage</li>
  <li>Hash-based route changes in apps with <a href="#spa">single-page application (SPA)</a> architectures</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools (and more!) help your teams optimize your end users' page load experience, eliminate bugs, and troubleshoot faster across your full stack.</p>
