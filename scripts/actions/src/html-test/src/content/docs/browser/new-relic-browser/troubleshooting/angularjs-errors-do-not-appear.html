<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>You're using AngularJS and want to report JavaScript errors to New Relic, but you don't see your application's errors on the <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/js-errors-dashboard-examining-errors-over-time"><strong>JavaScript errors</strong> page</a>.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>AngularJS applications often include a global error handler that catches all errors, and by default, Browser monitoring only reports uncaught errors.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/newrelicnoticeerror-browser-agent-api">noticeError</a> API call to report the errors to New Relic. This allows you to handle them as part of your regular error processing, but also see them within the New Relic UI.</p>
