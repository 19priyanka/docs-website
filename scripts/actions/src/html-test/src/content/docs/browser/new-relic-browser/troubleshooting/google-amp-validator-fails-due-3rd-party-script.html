<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/validate">Google AMP validator</a> fails when you include the Browser agent in HTML pages formatted for <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project</a>.</p>
<p>For example, you may see a validation error that says:</p>
<pre><code>The tag 'script' is disallowed except in specific forms.
</code></pre>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>To successfully validate your AMP pages and avoid the error message, set the following for your AMP pages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enable the <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/monitor-amp-pages-new-relic-browser">Browser monitoring for AMP</a> on your AMP pages.</li>
  <li>Disable the <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/disable-browser-monitoring-specific-pages">Browser monitoring agent</a> on your AMP pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures that AMP pages validate successfully and that the Browser agent continues to monitor your non-AMP pages.</p>
<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/spec">AMP spec</a>, HTML pages formatted for the AMP project are not allowed to contain any author-written or third-party JavaScript. By default, the Browser agent will be included in any pages served by your application, including the pages which are intended only for consumption by the AMP webcrawler.</p>
