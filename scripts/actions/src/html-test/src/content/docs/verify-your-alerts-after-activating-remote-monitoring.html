<p>This document explains why alerts are affected by enabling <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/remote-monitoring-host-legacy-integrations">remote monitoring</a> in the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, Nginx, and Redis integrations, and how to proceed if this happens.</p>

  <p>We strongly recommend reviewing the configuration of your alerts after activating the <code>remote_monitoring</code> flag.</p>

<h2>Managing alerts with remote monitoring walkthrough</h2>
<p>Activating remote monitoring in the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, Nginx, and Redis integrations modifies the entity reporting data. As a result, any alert set using entity-related parameters could stop behaving as expected and may need to be reconfigured.</p>
<p>Let's say you have an integration running with disabled remote monitoring and you set an alert to monitor the number of connected clients filtered by the entity key, in this case, <code>demo-redis-1</code>.</p>
<p>You decide to enable remote monitoring in your integration, and set the parameter <code>remote_monitoring</code> to true. After restarting the infrastructure agent, the alert stops monitoring. This happens because the entity resulting from activating remote monitoring has a different key, and therefore the current filter does not apply.</p>

<p>By filtering by the new entity key value, in this example <code>instance:127.0.0.1:6379</code>, your alert will be working as expected again.</p>

<p>With the new filter the alert behaves as expected.</p>
