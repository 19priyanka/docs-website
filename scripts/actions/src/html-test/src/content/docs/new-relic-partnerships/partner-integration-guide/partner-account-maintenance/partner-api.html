<p>New Relic offers a web service-based API through which partners can create, edit, upgrade, downgrade, and cancel New Relic accounts on behalf of their customers.</p>
<h2>API functions [#functions]</h2>
<p>The following functions are supported:</p>
<p><strong>Account:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create new</li>
  <li>Show</li>
  <li>Update</li>
  <li>Cancel</li>
  <li>Set primary admin</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>User:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Add user access to account</li>
  <li>Remove user access from account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subscription:</strong> Change subscription terms</p>
<h2>Initial API call [#initial-call]</h2>
<p>The initial API call for all account-level interactions is to "create account." This call returns an xml record of the newly created account. Part of this record is the <code>account_id</code>. All of the other calls in the Partner API require the <code>account_id</code> as a parameter. Provision will need to be made by the partner to parse the returned xml extract, store the <code>account_id</code>, and associate it with the users' partner account record.</p>
<h2>Password complexity and the API [#password]</h2>
<p>Starting with v2 of the Partner API, passwords passed as part of an account creation call will be required to meet the following complexity minimums:</p>
<ul>
  <li>8 to 50 characters in length</li>
  <li>Only contain letters, numbers, or special characters</li>
  <li>Cannot contain spaces</li>
  <li>Must contain at least 1 letter</li>
  <li>Must contain at least 1 number or special character</li>
</ul>
