<h2>Multiple sub-partnerships [#multiple-names]</h2>
<p>If your partnership does business under multiple names or in multiple different marketplaces using different branding, you can distinctively brand the different partnerships. This functionality is available using multiple sub-partnerships under a single partnership owner account. The partnerships can be distinct with several settings, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Product pricing</li>
  <li>Branding (headers, footers, etc.)</li>
  <li>Billing configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>After you log into your partnership owner account, you can select from the list of sub-partnership accounts.</p>
