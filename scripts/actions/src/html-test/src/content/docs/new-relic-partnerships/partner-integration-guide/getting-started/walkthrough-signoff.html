<p>As a final step before going live, an integration walkthrough will be performed (typically via a conference call). The goals of this call and typical topic areas are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Confirm the functionality of the integration.</li>
  <li>Understand and document the customer signup and usage UI workflow for the integration.</li>
  <li>Establish that mutual contractual commitments have been met.</li>
  <li>Evaluate ease of deployment.</li>
  <li>Create a plan for fine-tuning where required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where deployment of New Relic requires working accounts or deployed applications, provision should be made in advance of the call for these elements to be in place.</p>
