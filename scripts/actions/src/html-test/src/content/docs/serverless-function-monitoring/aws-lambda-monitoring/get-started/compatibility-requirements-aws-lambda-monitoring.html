<p>Before <a href="/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring">enabling serverless monitoring</a> for AWS Lambda, make sure you meet the <a href="#languages">requirements</a> and learn about <a href="#costs">AWS charges</a> resulting from its use.</p>
<h2>Supported languages [#languages]</h2>
<p>Our Lambda monitoring supports the following languages and <a href="/docs/agents">APM agent</a> versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go: 2.7.0</li>
  <li>Java: N/A, doesn't use agent</li>
  <li>.NET Core: N/A, doesn't use agent</li>
  <li>Node.js: 5.6.4</li>
  <li>Python: 4.6.0.106</li>
</ul>
<p>For complete Lambda instrumentation, you must use one of the language-specific <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk">AWS SDKs</a>. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail.</p>
<p>For the following services, only the "target" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS.</p>
<h2>About AWS costs [#costs]</h2>
<p><strong>Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges.</strong> Our <a href="/docs/install-enable-new-relics-monitoring-aws-lambda#manual-nr-lambda"><code>newrelic-log-ingestion</code> Lambda function</a>, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a <a href="/docs/licenses/license-information/acceptable-use-policy/acceptable-use-policy">Third Party Service</a>: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility.</p>
<p>If you use the Lambda Extension, you can avoid the CloudWatch Logs ingest charge for the telemetry gathered by New Relic.</p>
