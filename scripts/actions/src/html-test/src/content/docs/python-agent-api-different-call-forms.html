<p>For some functions, the New Relic Python agent API has several options for accomplishing the same thing. For example, tracing a function to provide more details on a New Relic-monitored transaction can theoretically be accomplished, depending on your setup, with any of the following APIs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>decorator</strong>. This is an import-time API. This will be the easiest option for most Python application setups.</li>
  <li>A <strong>context manager</strong>. This is a runtime-level API. These APIs might be used if you want to trace code that's not encapsulated in a function.</li>
  <li>A <strong>wrapper</strong>. The wrapper is used to create a wrapped function without the use of a decorator.</li>
  <li>A <strong>path-based wrapper</strong>. This would be used to wrap functions outside of the code they're declared in. For example, it can be used to instrument library code that you don't want to modify.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an example of a Python agent API with all four of these possible, see the <a href="/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/function_trace"><code>function_trace</code></a> call entry.</p>
