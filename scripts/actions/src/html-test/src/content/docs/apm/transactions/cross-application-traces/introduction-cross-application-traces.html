<p>New Relic APM's cross application tracing lets you link transactions between your APM-monitored applications. We also offer a <a href="/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing">distributed tracing feature</a>. Distributed tracing is an improvement on the cross application tracing feature and is recommended for large, distributed systems.</p>

<h2>What is cross application tracing? [#feature]</h2>
<p>New Relic APM's cross application traces link transactions between APM apps in your service-oriented architecture (SOA). This is useful, for example, to identify performance problems between your own application (the "calling" app) and any internal or external services (the "called" app), such as traffic to internal services.</p>
<p>This helps you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spot bottlenecks in your cross application call flows.</li>
  <li>Understand from end to end how specific transactions are used by other applications and services.</li>
  <li>Diagnose problems faster and enhance collaboration across teams.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security considerations [#security]</h2>
<p>Cross application tracing relies on three HTTP headers in order to exchange information between the calling and called applications.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first two (<code>X-NewRelic-ID</code> and <code>X-NewRelic-Transaction</code>) appear as HTTP request headers in outgoing requests sent by an instrumented application.</li>
  <li>The remaining header (<code>X-NewRelic-App-Data</code>) is inserted into the HTTP response if the called application belongs to the same New Relic account as the calling application.</li>
</ul>
<p>New Relic obfuscates all of these headers using an obfuscation scheme identical to what is used for New Relic Browser's configuration for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) but with a different key.</p>
