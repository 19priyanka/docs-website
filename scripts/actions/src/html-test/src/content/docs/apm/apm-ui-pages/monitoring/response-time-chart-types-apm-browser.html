<p>APM and browser monitoring have different types of charts available, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#time">Response time charts</a></li>
  <li><a href="#histogram">Histograms</a></li>
  <li><a href="#percent">Percentile line graphs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, on the APM summary UI page, these chart types are represented with these icons:</p>

<h2>Response time charts [#time]</h2>
<p>Response time charts are color-coded stacked bar charts. Response time is the duration of a <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm">transaction</a> from the perspective of the requester, and not necessarily the total sum of all time spent within a transaction. The relationship between response time and total amount of time is a reflection of how much concurrency is taking place among the instrumented code in your application.</p>

        <p>If response time is <strong>less than</strong> the total time spent, you are taking advantage of concurrency with a non-blocking or asynchronous computing model.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>If response time is <strong>equal to</strong> the total time spent, you may be using a blocking or synchronous computing model.</p>

        <p>If response time is <strong>greater than</strong> the total time spent, this may be due to resource contention. For example, if the response work runs in a highly contended thread pool, other jobs must finish prior to completing the response. (The agent does not track time spent waiting for resources.)</p>

<h2>Histogram charts [#histogram]</h2>
<p>Histogram charts graph the response time distribution for a selected time period.</p>
<p>Large outliers and long "tails" are common on browser charts with the histograms view selected. To help provide data in meaningful buckets, we intentionally cut off histogram data at the 95th percentile. Otherwise the histogram might need to be twice its size or more to accommodate a small percentage of outliers. (End user response time in Browser is also clamped.)</p>
<h2>Percent charts [#percent]</h2>
<p>For features that provide percentile charts (like APM and browser monitoring), we provide several percentile values to help you better understand response times:</p>
<ul>
  <li>99%: indicates that 99% of the response times occurred below this line. This is useful to find outliers.</li>
  <li>95%: indicates that 95% of the response times occurred below this line. This is useful for setting standards.</li>
  <li>Median: indicates where half of the response times are higher than this value, and half are lower.</li>
  <li>Average: average of all responses</li>
</ul>
<p>The percentile graph shows data for the selected app, not multiple apps that may be monitored by a single agent.</p>
