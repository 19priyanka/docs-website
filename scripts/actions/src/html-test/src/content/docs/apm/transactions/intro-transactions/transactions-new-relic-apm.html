<p>The word <strong>transaction</strong> can have several different meanings in the software industry. This document explains how the term is used by New Relic and how transactions are reported.</p>
<h2>What is a transaction? [#txn-defined]</h2>
<p>At New Relic, a <strong>transaction</strong> is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a <strong>web transaction</strong>, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent.</p>
<p>When you install APM in a <a href="/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-agents">supported system</a>, it begins automatically reporting web requests and other important functions and methods. To supplement the default level of monitoring, you can set up <a href="/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</a> to report additional transactions.</p>
<p>Some frameworks do not have a natural concept of a transaction. In other words, there are no predefined pathways that can easily be recognized or monitored as transactions. To define transactions in such frameworks, you can use <a href="/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Types of transactions [#types]</h2>
<p>Cumulative transaction data appears in APM on the <a href="/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page">Transactions page</a>. The two main categories of transactions are web and non-web:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Web</strong>: Transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-web</strong>: <a href="/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions">Non-web transactions</a> are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transaction segments [#segments]</h2>
<p>The individual functions and calls that make up a transaction are called <strong>segments</strong>. For example external service calls and database calls are segments, and both have their own UI pages in APM.</p>
<p>The APM <a href="/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page"><strong>Transactions</strong> page</a> displays aggregate transaction segment data.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To add segments to a transaction, use <a href="/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</a>.</li>
  <li>To see the segments of a specific transaction, use <a href="/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces">transaction traces</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transaction naming [#naming]</h2>
<p>For supported frameworks, transaction names can come from various sources, such as the name given to the transaction by the framework, function names detected during the transaction, or a web request's URL.</p>
<p>For transactions that produce many names with a similar format, we consolidate those into general transaction categories. For example, a transaction might be displayed as <code>/user/*/control_panel</code>, where the <code>*</code> represents different user names.</p>
<p>To rename transactions or adjust how names are consolidated, use <a href="/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Monitoring transactions [#other-features]</h2>
<p>Here are some other ways you can use APM to monitor transactions:</p>
<div data-component="Table" data-prop="W10=">
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>If you want to monitor...</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Use this...</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Transactions important to your business</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Create <a href="/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/introduction-key-transactions">key transactions</a>, which emphasizes them in the UI and lets you set a custom level of monitoring for them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Async activity</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Follow the procedures to set up asynchronous activity for your specific <a href="/docs/agents">APM language agent</a>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Activity across applications</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Linking transactions across applications gives you more detail about business-relevant application activity. For more information, see the documentation about <a href="/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing">distributed tracing</a> and <a href="/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/introduction-cross-application-traces">cross application traces</a>.</p>
        <div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
          <p>To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer">entity explorer</a>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h2>Query transactions [#insights]</h2>
<p>Transactions are available for querying with an in-depth set of <a href="/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-events-attributes/apm-default-event-attributes#transaction-event">default attributes</a> attached. Using these attributes, you can run queries and create custom charts that APM does not provide by default.</p>
<p>For information on how to query your data using our UI or NRQL, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data">Query New Relic data</a>.</p>
