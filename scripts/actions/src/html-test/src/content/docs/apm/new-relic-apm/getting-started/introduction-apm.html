<p>Application performance monitoring (APM) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/install-agent#apm-install">programming languages</a>. Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports.</p>
<h2>Why it matters [#why-matters]</h2>
<p>Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for <a href="/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/introduction-new-relic-go">Go</a>, <a href="/docs/agents/java-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-java">Java</a>, <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-net">.NET</a>, <a href="/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-nodejs">Node.js</a>, <a href="/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php">PHP</a>, <a href="/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-python">Python</a>, and <a href="/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-ruby">Ruby</a>, as well as a <a href="/docs/agents/c-sdk/get-started/introduction-c-sdk">C SDK</a>.</p>

        <p>When you sign in to <a href="/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page">APM</a> and select an app for your account, use the <strong>Summary</strong> page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page#charts">Web transactions response time:</a> Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else?</li>
          <li><a href="/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/viewing-transaction-traces">Transaction traces:</a> Which transactions are the slowest, and why?</li>
          <li><a href="/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/view-apm-error-analytics">Error rate</a> and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time?</li>
          <li><a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-compute-page-measure-resource-usage">Hosts:</a> What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.?</li>

        <p>Start by comparing the top twenty <a href="/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm">web transactions</a> or <a href="/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions">non-web transactions</a> in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries.</p>
        <p>Want to explore even deeper?</p>
        <ul>
