<p>APM provides service level agreement (SLA) reports. SLA reports help you better understand your application performance by showing application downtime and trends over time.</p>
<p>SLA reports for an application only include web transactions. If your application creates only non-web transactions, New Relic does not produce SLA reports for that app.</p>
<p>SLA reports can be viewed in APM or downloaded as comma-separated value (<strong>.csv</strong>) files. Depending on your account level's <a href="/docs/subscriptions/data-retention">data retention</a> policy, you can view daily, weekly, or monthly reports.</p>
<h2>View SLA reports [#procedure]</h2>
<p>To view the SLA reports for your app: Go to <strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a> > Applications > (select an app) > Reports > SLA</strong>. The report defaults to the <strong>Weekly SLA report</strong> tab. SLA report data shows the account owner's time zone, with periods beginning and ending at midnight in that time zone.</p>
<p>If you have not enabled <a href="/docs/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-process">browser</a> for your app, the SLA report shows links to requests, response time, and <a href="/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction">Apdex</a> only for your application server.</p>
