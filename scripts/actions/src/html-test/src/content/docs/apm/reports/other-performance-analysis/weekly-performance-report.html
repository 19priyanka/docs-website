<p>Every Monday, New Relic sends a weekly performance report via email to any of your account's users who have <a href="/docs/subscriptions/account-email-settings">selected to receive this report</a>. The email report contains summary performance metrics for the past week for a select group of your applications. The weekly performance report is different than APM's <a href="/docs/apm/reports/service-level-agreements/apm-sla-reports">Service Level Agreement (SLA) reports</a>.</p>

  <p>At this time, weekly performance reports are not available for accounts in the EU region.</p>
