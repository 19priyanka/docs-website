<p>APM's <strong>Deployments</strong> page lists recent deployments and their impact on your end user and app server's Apdex scores, response times, throughput, and errors. You can view and drill down details, use search and sort options, hide or delete the error, share it with others, or file a ticket about it.</p>
<h2>Set up deployment notifications [#dep_setup]</h2>
<p>For all APM agents, you can <a href="/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/recording-deployments">record deployments</a> by using webhooks or by using the New Relic REST API (v2). Some agents also have specific methods, such as the Java agent <code>jar</code> or the Python agent's <code>newrelic-admin</code> script.</p>
<h2>View deployment details [#dep_procedures]</h2>
<p>After you configure the deployment information, you can view and drill down into details:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a> > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments</strong>.</li>
  <li>Use any of New Relic's standard <a href="/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/standard-page-functions">user interface functions</a> to drill down into detailed information.</li>
  <li>To view details for a particular event, select its <strong>date</strong> link.</li>
  <li>To view the errors page for this deployment, select the <strong>error</strong> link.</li>
  <li>To view details for a specific deployment if applicable, select <strong>Change log</strong> or <strong>Change report</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Change log</strong> contains any detail provided through the <code>changelog</code> parameter when <a href="/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/recording-deployments">recording the deployment</a>. The <strong>Change report</strong> displays the behavior of the top ten transactions before and after the deployment.</p>
<h2>View performance after a deployment [#dep_timepicker]</h2>
<p>The <strong>Deployments</strong> page link for individual deployments appears on the selected app's <a href="/docs/applications-menu/applications-overview">Summary</a> page in the <strong>Events</strong> section. For time frames shorter than 14 days, a blue vertical bar on a chart will indicate a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, mouse over the blue bar.</p>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p>You can also use the <strong>Compare with</strong> option on your APM summary page to select a time period to compare the same data. If you enable <strong>Compare with</strong>, the UI does not show deployment markers.</p>
</div>
