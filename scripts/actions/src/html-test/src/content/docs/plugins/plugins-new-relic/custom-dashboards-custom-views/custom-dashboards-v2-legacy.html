<p>In February 2014, custom dashboards (v2) replaced our original custom dashboards feature (v1). Custom dashboards (v2) are part of a legacy feature and are being retained only for use with our <a href="#eol-plugins">legacy plugins tool</a>. In addition, plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center">EU region data center</a>.</p>

  <p>For an even better experience than plugins, go to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://newrelic.com/integrations"><strong>newrelic.com/integrations</strong></a>: Integrate the on-host and cloud systems you already use with New Relic, so you can filter and analyze data, create dashboards, and set alerts within a single platform.</li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.newrelic.com"><strong>developer.newrelic.com</strong></a>: Use developer tools to collect data from any source, automate workflows, build apps, and use our APIs.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]</h2>
<p>As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If youâ€™d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.</p>
<p>The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our <a href="https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832">Explorers Hub post</a>.</p>
