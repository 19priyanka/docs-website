<h2>Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]</h2>
<p>As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If youâ€™d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.</p>
<p>The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our <a href="https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832">Explorers Hub post</a>.</p>
<h2>Plugin help resources [#publisher]</h2>
<p>Each plugin in New Relic's Plugin Central typically includes troubleshooting information. When you select the plugin's <strong>Download</strong> or <strong>Continue</strong> button, the plugin should include a README file or refer to other documentation.</p>
<p>If you experience problems that the plugin's documentation does not address, contact the plugin publisher's support resources identified in the plugin's <strong>Get support</strong> link. Be prepared to provide information such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are you able to connect to the plugins UI or able to connect to the monitored server?</li>
  <li>Do you have a New Relic license key or a message about an invalid license key?</li>
  <li>If you received a specific error, what was its error number or message?</li>
  <li>Can you provide a screenshot of the plugin's webpage where you are experiencing problems?</li>
  <li>Can you provide a log file?</li>
  <li>Can you provide your configuration file?</li>
  <li>Can you restart the plugin?</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers">EU region data center</a>.</p>
