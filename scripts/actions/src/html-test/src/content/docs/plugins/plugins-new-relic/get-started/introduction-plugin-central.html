<h2>Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]</h2>
<p>As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If you’d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.</p>
<p>The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our <a href="https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832">Explorers Hub post</a>.</p>
<h2>Developers and SaaS providers [#platform]</h2>
<p>Plugin Central is where partners, third-party vendors, and users could publish plugin agents that collect selected data. This is also where you could install and view the plugin data on your Plugins dashboards as a set of summary metrics, charts, and tables.</p>
<p>In most cases, the plugin's agent runs on the users' app server. SaaS or PaaS providers can also create plugin agents that run on their system and report metrics for customers who use New Relic to monitor their applications. For more information, see the specific plugin agent SDK documentation.</p>
<h2>Plugin Central directory [#plugin_central]</h2>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJpbXBvcnRhbnQifV0=">
  <p>Plugins in Plugin Central are not supported with accounts that host data in the <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/our-eu-us-region-data-centers">EU region data center</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The plugin agent collects, sends, and stores the metric data. Plugin Central provides a searchable directory for plugins that developers publish and make publicly available to users.</p>
<p>From Plugin Central, you can select and download whatever plugins you want to use. After you install or configure a plugin, you can view the plugin's dashboard data securely from the plugins user interface in New Relic One.</p>
<h2>View plugins in Plugin Central [#plugin_central]</h2>
<p>To view information about available (published) plugins: Go to <strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a> > More > Plugins</strong>. By default, available plugins appear in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>From the Plugin Central directory in New Relic One, select any published plugin to view a description and install it.</p>
<p>Depending on the selected plugin, installation and configuration instructions will vary. Refer to your plugin's documentation for specific details. After you install or configure a plugin, it automatically appears on your Plugins menu in New Relic One, where you can select and view it directly. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to appear.</p>
<h2>Get started with plugins [#terminology]</h2>
<p>Here are some tips for making the most of Plugin Central.</p>
<div data-component="CollapserGroup" data-prop="W10=">
  <div data-component="Collapser" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJpZCIsInZhbHVlIjoicmF0aW5ncyJ9LHsidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ0aXRsZSIsInZhbHVlIjoiUmF0aW5ncyJ9XQ==">
    <div data-prop-text="title">Ratings</div>
    <p>Plugins listed in New Relic's Plugin Central include a 5-star rating system, ranging from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). This helps you make more informed choices when choosing among similar plugins. This also provides a way for you to share what you think of a plugin.</p>
    <p>You can rate as many plugins as you want. If you have not voted for a plugin, its current star rating (gold or gray) does not include an outline.</p>
    <p>You can have only one vote for a specific plugin, and you cannot delete your vote. However, you can change your rating level anytime. After you select the star level (1 to 5) to cast your vote, the stars change to gold with an outline at the rating level you selected.</p>
  </div>
  <div data-component="Collapser" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJpZCIsInZhbHVlIjoicmV2aWV3cyJ9LHsidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ0aXRsZSIsInZhbHVlIjoiUmV2aWV3cyJ9XQ==">
    <div data-prop-text="title">Reviews</div>
    <p>Plugin Central includes a simple review system to share what you think of a plugin and to provide tips for others about installation and usage. Existing reviews appear when you select an individual plugin's title or <strong>Get started</strong> link.</p>
    <p>You can write as many reviews for as many plugins as you want, following the <a href="#feedback-policy">feedback policy</a>. You can also edit or delete your own reviews. When you write a review for a plugin, if you have not already rated the plugin, you must provide a rating. Subsequent reviews will use the rating you provided. You can change your rating at any time.</p>
    <p>Plugin administrators also reserve the right to delete reviews if necessary. For more information, see <a href="#feedback-policy">Plugin feedback policy</a>.</p>
