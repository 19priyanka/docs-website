<h2>Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]</h2>
<p>As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If youâ€™d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.</p>
<p>The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our <a href="https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832">Explorers Hub post</a>.</p>
<h2>Plan your plugin [#planning]</h2>
<p>When planning your plugin for Plugin Central:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sketch the types of metrics you want to collect and how you want to present them on dashboards. Include any necessary mathematical calculations.</li>
  <li>Sketch the types of summary metrics you want to collect and how you want to present them on the plugin's summary page. Include any necessary mathematical calculations.</li>
  <li>Optional: Define alert conditions for your metrics.</li>
  <li>Optional: If you want to receive alert notifications for your plugin, verify the email address to be used and confirm any other notification options as necessary.</li>
  <li>Decide whether to develop the plugin with one of the plugin SDKs or to use the Plugin API.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Create your plugin [#creating]</h2>
<p>When creating your plugin for Plugin Central:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a unique, meaningful GUID name.</li>
  <li>Write the plugin agent.</li>
  <li>Test your plugin, including summary metrics, customized dashboards, alert conditions, and your process to disable or uninstall your plugin.</li>
  <li>Consider writing Chef and Puppet installation scripts to make plugin installation easier.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Publish your plugin [#publshing]</h2>
<p>The following items are required for plugins published through New Relic's Plugin Central. If you do not plan to make your plugin publicly accessible to users, some of these items are not applicable.</p>

              <li>Can you temporarily disable and then re-enable the plugin (for example, for troubleshooting or updating it), or must you completely uninstall and reinstall?</li>

    <p>Review the <a href="https://rpm.newrelic.com/terms_of_service/developer">Developer Terms of Service</a> for New Relic Plugins. A link to this document appears on your plugin's <strong>Publish</strong> page in the UI.</p>

    <div data-prop-text="title">Publication</div>
    <p>Plugin Central is the repository of plugins available in New Relic. If you want to distribute your plugin through Plugin Central, make sure your documentation and support plans are in place, then select your plugin's <strong>Publish</strong> option in the New Relic UI.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Publish</strong> page in the UI prompts you to verify all requirements. As soon as your plugin is published, all of its dashboards and summary metrics are available for your plugin users.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Distribution method</strong> identifies how users can obtain your plugin from Plugin Central.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>File download:</strong> Most developers typically select this option for plugin setup and installation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Webpage link:</strong> SaaS providers typically select this option for plugin configuration and identify their website's landing page URL.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Platform Installer (NPI):</strong> If you use the New Relic Platform Installer (NPI) command line utility to package your plugin, select this option.</p>
        <p>You can also publish a plugin without listing it in Plugin Central; for example, if you want to beta test it first, or if you only want specific users to be able to use it. When publishing an unlisted plugin, make sure the checkbox option in the UI for <strong>List this plugin in Plugin Central</strong> is not selected. You will need to communicate directly with your users when your unlisted plugin is added, updated, or removed.</p>
      </li>

    <div data-prop-text="title">Versions</div>
    <p>You can update and re-publish your plugin as often as you want. Every time you publish changes to your plugin and list them in Plugin Central, the changes are immediately visible in Plugin Central. In addition, your published plugin changes typically appear in New Relic's website within five minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> To avoid development and testing impacts on your users, maintain dev and production versions when updating your plugin.</p>

<h2>Plugin support [#troubleshooting]</h2>
<p>Plugin publishers are responsible for providing first-line support if users have problems using their plugin. This includes verifying correct data acquisition and transmission.</p>
<p>If problems continue with getting the expected data into New Relic's user interface after you complete your troubleshooting procedures, then you (not your users) can escalate the problem to New Relic. We will work with you to resolve the problem, and then you can communicate the solution to your users.</p>

    <div data-prop-text="title">Support for your plugin users</div>
    <p>Follow these guidelines for supporting your plugin's users by confirming data collection and transmission.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Check that the plugin configuration is correct, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Necessary credentials for the target system</li>
          <li>IP addresses or DNS names for the target system</li>
          <li>Any settings that might affect data acquisition</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Review transmission logs for errors, including:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Connection errors</li>
          <li>Error responses from the target system</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Review transaction logs for useful data.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How much data is being collected?</li>
          <li>Does the data make sense?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Verify if the plugin is converting acquired data into useful metrics.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do the metrics make sense?</li>
          <li>Would the metrics make a good chart?</li>
          <li>Are the metrics being aggregated into valid JSON?</li>
          <li>Is the JSON size within limits?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Confirm transmission of the plugin data.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are using an SDK for New Relic Plugins and the Plugin API, does your data transmission conform to New Relic's rate limits?</li>
          <li>Are the 50X codes sporadic or continuous?</li>
          <li>Do your transaction logs indicate any data transmission problems?</li>
