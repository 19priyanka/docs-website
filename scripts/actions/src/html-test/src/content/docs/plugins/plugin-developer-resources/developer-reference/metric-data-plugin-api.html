<h2>Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]</h2>
<p>As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If youâ€™d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.</p>
<p>The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our <a href="https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832">Explorers Hub post</a>.</p>
<h2>URI</h2>
<p>Metric timeslice data is sent with the Plugin API as an HTTP POST of JSON data using this URI:</p>
<pre><code>https://platform-api.newrelic.com/platform/v1/metrics
</code></pre>
<p>The Plugin API does not support New Relic's REST API, and vice versa. However, you can use the REST API (v2) to <a href="/docs/plugins/plugin-developer-resources/developer-reference/extracting-plugin-data-new-relics-rest-api">extract plugin data</a>. For a list with links to procedures and examples, see <a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/plugin-examples-v2">Plugin examples (v2)</a>.</p>
<h2>GUID</h2>
<p>The plugin needs a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID), which is a character string limited to no less than 4 and no more than 255 characters. The GUID for a published plugin must be unique for each plugin. When creating a plugin, you are responsible for managing your own GUIDs to avoid naming conflicts.</p>
<h2>Time periods for metrics [#metric_duration]</h2>
<p>Metrics that appear in dashboards are reported with a duration. The end time is implied by the time New Relic receives the metric(s). Thus, you cannot define metric values that both start and end in the future, or start and end in the past.</p>
<p>The Plugin API is designed for live metrics only, not historical metric collection. Metrics may only be reported for a period starting in the past (no more than a few hours) and ending upon reporting.</p>
<p>The charts on your plugin's dashboards can show any time period you want; for example, 30 minutes, 30 days, etc. You can also deliver data at 1-hour intervals. New Relic does not extrapolate data values between the data points delivered. For example, data will aggregate when there is too much, but data will not be extrapolated if there is not enough data. In order for data to appear on a 30 minute chart, make sure at least one data point is within the range, or no data will appear.</p>
<p>Use a 60-second polling interval, because the default dashboard shows 30 minutes of data, which gives 30 data points for the chart. Or, if you want to show 3 days of data, use a 1-hour polling interval, which provides 24*3=72 data points for your chart.</p>
<h2>Metric data details [#metric_data_details]</h2>
<p>The JSON data is a hash with two required keys at the top level:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>components</code>: An array of components, each consisting of a hash of attributes for the individual component, including the metric data.</li>
  <li><code>agent</code>: A hash describing the agent that is reporting metrics data to New Relic Plugins on behalf of the component(s). Of these values, only <code>host</code> and <code>version</code> are required.</li>
</ul>
<p>When graphing metrics, be aware that null = zero.</p>

<h2>Timeslice metric values [#timeslice]</h2>
<p>Metrics are sent inside the <code>component</code> hash with the key <code>metrics</code> and a hash as a value. The hash keys are metric names, and the values are the timeslice data values for the named metric. The <code>timeslice</code> hash value uses one of three formats:</p>
<div data-component="Table" data-prop="W10=">
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Timeslice hash value</strong></p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>A single scalar value with a floating point number or integer</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>This is the simplest format, and this number is required. The reported value is used as the total, minimum, and maximum data value. The count value is assumed to be 1.</p>
        <p>The Plugin API does not support reporting of arbitrary string metrics, only scalar values that are aggregated.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Array of five required values in specific order</p>
      </div>
      <div>

        <ul>
          <li>Total value over the time period</li>
          <li>Count of the number of events this value represents over the time period; the average is calculated by dividing total by count</li>
          <li>Minimum value over the time period</li>
          <li>Maximum value over the time period</li>
          <li>Sum of squares for the samples over the time period</li>

    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Hash with five required key/value pairs in any order</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>A hash with value names as the keys, and integers or floating point values as the values. All five key/value pairs are required. The keys of the hash are the type of timeslice data, and the value is the data value. These has key/value pairs can be in any order:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>total</code>: Total value over the time period</li>
          <li><code>count</code>: Count of the number of events this value represents over the time period; the average is calculated by dividing total by count</li>
          <li><code>min</code>: Minimum value over the time period</li>
          <li><code>max</code>: Maximum value over the time period</li>
          <li><code>sum_of_squares</code>: Sum of squares for the samples over the time period</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h2>Calculations</h2>
<p>Limited mathematical calculations are available with the key/value pairs, such as computing total, count, minimum, maximum, averages, and standard deviations. However, to do more extensive calculations, you need to do the math in the agent, and then send the results as a new metric. For example, send Metric1, Metric2, and Metric3 (which equals Metric1 divided by Metric2).</p>
<p>If you submit negative metric values, the charts on your plugin's dashboards will not show them. However, the summary metrics for your plugin will show negative values.</p>

    <div data-prop-text="title">Metric segments</div>
    <p>Each of these segments is divided by the forward slash <code>/</code> character. Each segment is interpreted for a specific purpose in the UI and roughly follows this pattern:</p>
    <pre><code>prefix/category/label[units]

</code></pre>&#x3C;Table>
    &#x3C;thead>
    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;th width={200}>

    &#x3C;tbody>
    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;td>
    Prefix:
    `Component/` or `Custom/`
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;td>
    The first segment of a custom metric is `Component/` (if it comes from a plugin agent) or `Custom/` (if it is a custom metric collected by a New Relic agent. For example, `Custom/MyMetric`).
    &#x3C;Callout variant="caution">
    If you use the Plugin API only, and if the metrics do **not** start with `Component/`, they may not be available or may not appear correctly in charts and dashboards.
    &#x3C;/Callout>

    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;td>
    Category name
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;td>
    The second part of a custom metric is a category name, used to group metrics into different categories. For example, the metrics reported by a database plugin may fall into categories such as schema, tables, or connections.
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;/tr>
    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;td>
    Label
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;td>
    The third part of the metric name is used for labeling the data when it appears in tables and charts. If it contains multiple segments, each slash separating the segments of the label will be rendered as part of the label.
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;/tr>
    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;td>
    Units
    &#x3C;/td>

    <pre><code>
Component/Cache/Hits[sec|hit]

</code></pre>For example, the metric representing the latency of cache hits reported by a plugin collecting data for a cache appliance might look like this:
  </div>
  <div data-component="Collapser" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJpZCIsInZhbHVlIjoibWV0cmljX2F0dHJpYnV0ZXMifSx7InR5cGUiOiJtZHhBdHRyaWJ1dGUiLCJuYW1lIjoidGl0bGUiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6Ik1ldHJpYyBhdHRyaWJ1dGVzIn1d">
    <div data-prop-text="title">Metric attributes</div>
    <p>Most metrics are defined statically and represent some global state; for example, cache size. Other metrics are dynamic and include some contextual attribute like the name of a host or a file. These metrics need to be structured so you can easily show them as a group in a table stacked in a chart.</p>
    <p>To add attribute names to a metric, put them in trailing segments separated by a forward slash <code>/</code> character. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>Component/Disk/Bytes In/dev001
Component/Network/External services/ae592c3.aws.com

</code></pre>
    <pre><code>
Component/Users/*[visits]

</code></pre>&#x3C;Callout variant="caution">
    Avoid overloading the metric space by putting in segment values that have a large range of values.
    &#x3C;/Callout>
    While something like a customer's region in an attribute is a reasonable thing to track in the metric, the customer name would not be if you have more than a few hundred customers. If your agent starts sending an excessive amount of metrics, your metrics may be automatically collapsed into groups with wildcards:
    <pre><code>
Component/Tables/Row count/DB001/BLOG_POSTS[rows]

</code></pre>You can specify more than one attribute as long as they occupy the same position for a given metric category and label:

  <div data-component="Collapser" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJpZCIsInZhbHVlIjoibWV0cmljX3ZhbHVlcyJ9LHsidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ0aXRsZSIsInZhbHVlIjoiTWV0cmljIHZhbHVlcyJ9XQ==">
    <div data-prop-text="title">Metric values</div>
    <p>You can report a metric value in one of two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Single value: This typically is the <code>value</code> being reported for that time slice. If you use an SDK, you report the single value to the SDK. It handles tracking the rest of these values.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Set of aggregate value: This includes the min, max, and sum of squares values for the <code>value</code> being reported. If you use the Plugin API, the preferred method is to report all of the values.</p>
        <p>When aggregating a series of timeslice data into a single timeslice data entry for a given period, all fields are summed except for the min and max value. If you are using an SDK plugins, this is done automatically. If you are using the Plugin API to develop plugins, you need to code for this.</p>
        <p>A metric value contains several fields, but it is represented primarily by the <code>count</code> and <code>value</code>. The <code>count</code> is a 32-bit integer field, and the <code>value</code> is a 32-bit float. Metric values can represent more than one data point or sample as an aggregation of measures. Typically the <code>count</code> is the number of samples, and the <code>value</code> is the total value of all samples.</p>
        <p>Here are the fields in a metric value:</p>
        <div data-component="Table" data-prop="W10=">
          <div>
            <div>
              <div>
                <p>Metric value</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>Description</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <div>
                <p><code>count</code></p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>The number of things being measured. If data is collected at the time the event occurs, like with some kind of injection, then the count in the timeslice data will be 1.</p>
                <p><strong>Required</strong> if it is not 1 (0 generally represents an absent value).</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div>
                <p><code>value</code></p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p><strong>Required</strong>: The total value measured across all things being counted. When averages are calculated later, we divide the value by the count. In some cases, the value field is irrelevant.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div>
                <p><code>min</code>, <code>max</code></p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>The minimum and maximum values when the count is greater than 1. When the count is 1, these are the same as the <code>value</code>.</p>
                <p>Optional depending on whether they are available or relevant for a given metric.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div>
                <p><code>sum of squares</code></p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>This is the sum of squares of each <code>value</code> and is useful when the values follow a standard distribution. You can only capture this value when you are collecting data each time the event happens. You store the value of the event in the <code>value</code> field and the square of the value in the <code>sum of squares</code>. This is used to calculate a standard deviation later on.</p>
                <p>The <code>sum of squares</code> is optional. It is used to calculate a standard deviation for a selection of data. If standard deviation for the value is not meaningful, such as when the values are not part of a normal distribution, then the <code>sum of squares</code> is omitted.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div data-component="Collapser" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJpZCIsInZhbHVlIjoidW5pdHNfc2FtcGxlX21ldHJpY3MifSx7InR5cGUiOiJtZHhBdHRyaWJ1dGUiLCJuYW1lIjoidGl0bGUiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6IlVuaXRzIn1d">
    <div data-prop-text="title">Units</div>
    <p>When a metric value is collected by periodically sampling an interface, the count units are implicitly samples, and the value units are whatever is being sampled. For data it might be bytes. For throughput it might be something like kilobytes/second. For utilization (like CPU) it might be percent. When the count units are samples, they can be omitted in the metric name.</p>
    <p>Units of time, bytes, and bits may get special treatment, allowing additional conversion in the user interface between magnitudes. For example, if you specify a metric with units of kilobytes, then in the UI you may be presented the option of displaying a chart of Mb.</p>
    <p>Metrics units describe what the <code>value</code> field and <code>count</code> represent. Units are specified inside brackets and consist of units for the value, followed by a pipe (<code>|</code>) and then the units for the count. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>Component/metric_id[value_unit|count_unit]

</code></pre>Count units are calls and value units are seconds. The default count metric is not being used, so you need to specify it. The bar separates the value units from the count units.
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;/tr>
    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;td>
    Units in charts
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;td>
    The units specified in a metric have several implications for the way the values are interpreted by generic charts and tables:
    * Units display in labels and tooltips in charts to indicate what the values represent.
    * Units imply a set of different values available from a single metric value.
    When creating a chart in a dashboard, the dashboard author selects one of the available value methods for that metric to plot in the chart.
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;/tr>
    &#x3C;/tbody>
    &#x3C;/Table>
    <pre><code>
        Component/metric_id[seconds|call]
        
</code></pre>The count units are samples (default) and the value units are bytes/second. The forward slash separates the units from the interval.
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;/tr>
    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;td>
    Count with units
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;td>
    A common case for declaring units is when measuring response times. If the custom metric represents the average latency of a call to a cache, then the units for the metric value are **seconds per call**. For example:
    <pre><code>
        Component/metric_id[bytes/second]
        
</code></pre>&#x3C;Table>
    &#x3C;thead>
    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
    Units for plugin metrics
    &#x3C;/th>
    &#x3C;th>
    Notes
    &#x3C;/th>
    &#x3C;/tr>
    &#x3C;/thead>
    &#x3C;tbody>
    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;td>
    Naming conventions
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;td>
    You can have mixed-case unit names. They.can consist strictly of alphabetical characters as well as the `_`, `%`, or `/` symbols. Case is preserved. Punctuation markers, dashes, spaces and any other symbols are not allowed.
    **Recommendation:** Use uncapitalized words, spelled out in full. For example, use `second` not `sec`.
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;/tr>
    &#x3C;tr>
    &#x3C;td>
    Rate metrics
    &#x3C;/td>
    &#x3C;td>
    When a metric value represents a rate, such as bytes/second, then the value is assumed to be a sample for the given interval. The units specifier looks like **\[bytes/second]** since the count units are implicitly samples. For example:
    <pre><code>
Component/metric_id[|count_unit]

</code></pre>In rare cases there will only be a unit value for `count`. The value will be interpreted as unitless. Value units are omitted, and the vertical bar appears in front of the count units. For example:
    <pre><code>
Component/metric_id[value_unit/interval]

</code></pre>**Exception:** The pipe and count units (`|[count_unit]`) are not required after the value unit for samples.
    Rate metrics are commonly defined as sample per interval. This is defined as `units/interval` in the metric, with a forward slash to separate units from interval. For example:
  </div>
</div>
