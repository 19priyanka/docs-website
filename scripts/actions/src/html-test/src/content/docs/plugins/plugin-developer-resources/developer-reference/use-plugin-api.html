<h2>Limited access to legacy plugins [#eol-plugins]</h2>
<p>As of December 2, 2020, plugin access is limited to accounts that have accessed a plugin in the past 30 days. We will provide access to add plugins on a per-account basis. If youâ€™d like to continue to use plugins for your accounts, please contact your New Relic account team, and we will work with you on a per-account situation.</p>
<p>The plugin experience will reach end of life (EoL) in June 2021. For more information, see our <a href="https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/first-notice-limiting-access-to-new-relic-plugins/121832">Explorers Hub post</a>.</p>
<h2>Before you begin [#before_you_begin]</h2>
<p>Using a development language other than Ruby, .NET, or Java for a plugin agent means you do not have an SDK to work with, but you do have some benefits. This is a guide for plugin developers to get started with writing an agent in any language that can work directly with the Plugin API for Plugin Central.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can use any language you want, as long as it supports sending JSON through HTTP POST. This allows for better integration with your systems.</li>
  <li>For the same reason, it is the best option for SaaS-based plugin agents.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if you are not using the Plugins SDK for Java. .NET, or Ruby, you have some additional setup and planning to do in developing a plugin agent. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Error tracking on POST calls</li>
  <li>A method for tracking and aggregating data when a POST fails</li>
  <li>Your own support plans if a New Relic SDK for your language or development tools is not available</li>
</ul>
<p>Any publicly available plugins in the Plugin Central should come bundled with their source code if the executable code is not plain text. This allows you to both try out plugins and to review the code.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Before authoring a plugin, install some existing plugins using the Java SDK, .NET SDK, or Ruby SDK to see how they are written.</p>
<h2>Metric data POST [#post]</h2>
<p>Metric data is sent as an HTTP POST of JSON data using this URI:</p>
<pre><code>https://platform-api.newrelic.com/platform/v1/metrics
</code></pre>
<p>The MIME-type for the POST is application/json.</p>
<p>The Plugins feature is designed to receive a continuous stream of metrics at a certain maximum speed, and to present this information on useful charts. The recommended frequency for sending data to Plugins is to send 60 seconds worth of data once a minute. Agents sending data more frequently than twice a minute on average may be subject to enforced limits on the number of metrics being saved.</p>
<p>The following are recommended soft limits. Requests smaller than this will work; requests larger than this are subject to rejection or automatic data aggregation. As a hard cap, <strong>the total size of the POST payload should be no larger than 1MB (10^6 bytes).</strong></p>
<p>If the metric is "expensive" to calculate and does not change quickly, consider writing your plugin agent so that it skips some polling cycles to retrieve data and then sends the last value. This produces better results for your plugin users' dashboards.</p>

<h2>Data aggregation [#aggregation]</h2>
<p>The SDKs manage data aggregation in the event of a failed POST. If you are not using an SDK, you need to manage this yourself.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include all five metric values in a POST: min, max, total, count, and sum or squares. (<strong>Exception:</strong> This may not be necessary for monotonic metrics where short term variation is not an issue.)</li>
  <li>Recompute these values for the accumulating metric data as required by what is being measured, incrementing the duration accordingly, until a successful POST is sent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compression</h2>
<p>Data can be sent in the following encoding formats:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>identity</code></li>
  <li><code>deflate</code></li>
  <li><code>gzip</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If data is sent compressed, make sure the <code>Content-Encoding</code> header specifies the type of encoding.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Here are some examples for developing plugins.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>components</code>: An array of components, each consisting of a hash of attributes for the individual component. Multiple components can be sent with a single. Each component has its own name, GUID, duration, and metrics.</p>
        <pre><code>{
  "agent": {
    "host" : "db.internal.your_company.com",
    "pid" : 1234,

<h2>API responses and error codes [#errors]</h2>
