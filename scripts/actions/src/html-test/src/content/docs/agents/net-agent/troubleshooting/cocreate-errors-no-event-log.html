<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>After you generate traffic and wait a few minutes, your .NET application does not report data to New Relic. In addition, there is no New Relic event log for your .NET app.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>You may be running another profiler that conflicts with New Relic. Due to the architecture of .NET, you can run only one profiler at a time.</p>
<p>To verify whether New Relic is conflicting with another profiler:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Check your application event log for errors; for example:</p>
    <pre><code>NET Runtime version 2.0.50727.4234 - Failed to CoCreate profiler. Profiler CLSID: '{TRQGTQJM-KMJB-FQGP-VNGG-KUQTZWCKQ6QQ}'.
</code></pre>
    <pre><code>NET Runtime version 4.0.30319.296 - Loading profiler failed during CoCreateInstance. Profiler CLSID: '{FF68FEB9-E58A-4B75-A2B8-90CE7D915A26}'.
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compare the CLSID in the error to New Relic's CLSIDs:</p>
    <pre><code>71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41
FF68FEB9-E58A-4B75-A2B8-90CE7D915A26
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the CLSID does not match, uninstall the other profiler.</li>
      <li>If the CLSID does match, check for <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/cocreateinstance-errors-no-profiler-log">CoCreateInstance permissions errors</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>These <code>NET Runtime version</code> errors indicate there is another .NET profiler running. The New Relic .NET agent must be registered as a profiler with the Common Language Runtime (CLR) as a profiler in order to function. The CLR calls out to the .NET agent when code is loaded, and the agent instruments the code for the method call as appropriate.</p>
