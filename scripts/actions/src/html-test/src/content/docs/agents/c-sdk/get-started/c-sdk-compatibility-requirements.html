<p>New Relic's C SDK provides a generic library you can customize to communicate with New Relic. Before you install New Relic's C SDK, make sure your system meets these requirements. Also refer to the <a href="/docs/c-sdk-licenses">C SDK licenses documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Language versions [#language-release]</h2>
<p>The C SDK allows you to instrument any application on Linux, provided:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You must have access to the source code.</li>
  <li>The target language must be able to import C libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the C SDK to create instrumentation for applications written in C and C++. You can also use it in languages like Perl, which are implemented in C or C++, and in any language that has a foreign function interface with C.</p>
<h2>Operating environments [#operating-systems]</h2>
<p>The C SDK works in 64-bit Linux operating systems with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>gcc 4.8 or higher</li>
  <li>glibc 2.17 or higher</li>
  <li>Kernel version 2.6.26 or higher</li>
  <li>libpcre 8.20 or higher</li>
  <li>libpthread</li>
  <li>cmake 2.8 or higher</li>
</ul>
<p>Compiling the New Relic daemon requires Go 1.7 or higher.</p>
<h2>License key [#license]</h2>
<p>For any installation, you will need your New Relic <a href="/docs/accounts-partnerships/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key">license key</a>. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account.</p>
<h2>Processor type [#processor]</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Intel (and compatible) platforms only</li>
  <li>Support for SSE2 instructions is required</li>
</ul>
<h2>Security requirements [#security]</h2>
<p>As a standard <a href="/docs/accounts-partnerships/new-relic-security/security/data-security">security measure for data collection</a>, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.</p>
<h2>Database and instance-level performance [#datastores]</h2>
<p>You can collect <a href="/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues">instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers</a>. You can also view slow query trace details for the following SQL-based database platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firebird</li>
  <li>Informix</li>
  <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>Oracle</li>
  <li>Postgres</li>
  <li>SQLite</li>
  <li>Sybase</li>
</ul>
