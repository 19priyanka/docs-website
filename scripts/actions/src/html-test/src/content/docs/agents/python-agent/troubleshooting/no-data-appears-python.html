<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>After installing the Python agent, generating some traffic, and waiting five minutes, your data does not appear in the New Relic UI.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Here are some tips for troubleshooting missing data, placed in approximate order of the likelihood of them being the problem:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure that you installed the agent on the same environment as your application. If you're using a virtual environment, install it there.</li>
  <li>Make sure your agent is up to date. If you downloaded it from the New Relic site rather than use <strong>pip</strong> or <strong>easy_install</strong>, compare your version number to the <a href="https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">current release</a>.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics">New Relic Diagnostics</a> to try to automatically identify the issue.</li>
  <li>Make sure data can get to the New Relic UI by running the <a href="/docs/python/testing-the-python-agent">Python agent test</a>.</li>
  <li>Ensure you meet the <a href="/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-python-agent">compatibility and requirements</a>. Check for any special requirements for the <a href="/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-mechanisms">web framework or web server</a> you're using.</li>
  <li>Review the configuration file that was generated with the <code>newrelic-admin generate-config</code> command to make sure it contains the correct license key.</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/agents/python-agent/troubleshooting/generating-logs-troubleshooting">Generate detailed logs for troubleshooting</a>. Then check the log files for error messages. If the log file is missing, ensure that you have permissions to write to that location.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, if no data appears and you see warning messages about activating or reactivating your app, follow the <a href="/docs/agents/python-agent/troubleshooting/activate-application-warning-python">activation troubleshooting procedures</a>.</p>
