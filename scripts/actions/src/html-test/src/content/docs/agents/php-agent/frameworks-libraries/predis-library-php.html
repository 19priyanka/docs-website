<p>New Relic added support for the Predis library in PHP agent <a href="/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-422099">release 4.22</a>.</p>
<p>The agent instruments standard calls to a <code>Predis\Client</code> object or to a pipeline. Any commands sent via a pipeline will be grouped and treated as a single command metric named <code>pipeline</code> rather than the individual commands.</p>
<p>The PHP agent does not support calls to the <code>executeRaw</code> or <code>transaction</code> methods, PubSub, monitor, or similar. These will not be instrumented.</p>
