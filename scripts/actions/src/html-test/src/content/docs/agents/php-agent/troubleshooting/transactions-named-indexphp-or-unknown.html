<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The PHP agent collects metric data, but all of your transactions are named <code>/index.php</code> or <code>/unknown</code>.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>If the agent is not detecting your framework for some transactions, you can use our <a href="/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-api#api-name-wt">API</a> to name your transactions.</p>
<pre><code>if (extension_loaded ('newrelic')) {
  newrelic_name_transaction ($controller . '/' . $action);
}
</code></pre>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Do not name your transactions with values that change often, such as user IDs, hashes, and so on. Implement <a href="/docs/agents/php-agent/features/php-frameworks-integrating-support-new-relic">useful transaction naming</a> in your API calls.</p>
</div>
<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>New Relic probably cannot accurately detect or hook into your specific framework. This often occurs because the supported framework's default dispatching method has been modified (often by a plugin) or is no longer being used. If that happens, New Relic may not be able to detect or hook into the framework's dispatcher, and it will not be able to provide a meaningful transaction naming structure.</p>
