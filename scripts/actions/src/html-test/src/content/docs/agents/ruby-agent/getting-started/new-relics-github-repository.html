<p>New Relic clones the Ruby repository on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/tree/main">newrelic-ruby-agent</a>. GitHub also hosts limited rdoc-generated documentation: <a href="https://rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent">rdoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent</a>.</p>
<p>The head of main will generally have New Relic's latest release. However, we reserve the ability to push an edge to the master. If you download a release from GitHub, use the appropriate tag. We usually push beta versions of a release to a working branch before tagging them for General Availability.</p>
<p>Fork away and feel free to send us pull requests (branches only please) for any ideas or bugfixes you come up with at <a href="https://support.newrelic.com/">support.newrelic.com</a>.</p>
