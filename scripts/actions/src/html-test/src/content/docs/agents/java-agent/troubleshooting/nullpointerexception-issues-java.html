<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>If your <a href="/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/no-log-file-java">log data</a> shows <code>SEVERE:</code> or <code>ERROR:</code> with <code>NullPointerException</code> issues, there may be issues that are interfering with reporting.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Before you begin these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the <a href="/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/upgrade-java-agent">most recent version</a> of New Relic's Java agent.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use case-sensitive searches of your Java agent log file for lines with <code>SEVERE:</code> and <code>ERROR: NullPointerException</code>.</li>
  <li>If you find any lines with these messages, <a href="/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/providing-troubleshooting-information-java">gather troubleshooting information</a> to get support at New Relic.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>New Relic's Java agent between versions 3.0.0 and 3.2.3 would incorrectly log the error messages. For example:</p>
<pre><code>ERROR: javax/servlet/ServletOutputStream is marked as a weaved class, but no methods are matched to be weaved.
</code></pre>
<p>This was entirely erroneous and is not a cause for concern. However, do not use these versions. Instead, update to the <a href="/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/upgrade-java-agent">most recent version</a> of New Relic's Java agent.</p>
