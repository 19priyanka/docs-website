<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The New Relic PHP agent does not support any Apache multi-processing model (MPM) that involves threading.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The PHP language development team <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.apache2.php" title="Link opens in a new window">discourages the use of a threaded MPM with Apache</a>, and we have chosen not to implement support for threaded MPMs in the PHP agent for similar stability reasons. This includes the <strong>worker</strong> and <strong>event</strong> MPMs.</p>
<p>If the default, non-threaded <strong>prefork</strong> MPM is unsuitable for your needs for performance reasons, we suggest using <strong>mod_fcgid</strong> and <strong>php-fpm</strong> to use PHP via FastCGI instead.</p>
