<p>If you <a href="/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/install-php-agent-shared-hosting-service">install New Relic for WordPress websites</a>, the PHP agent receives additional metrics. A <strong>WordPress</strong> page appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to <a href="http://one.newrelic.com/"><strong>one.newrelic.com</strong></a> <strong>> APM > (select a WordPress app)</strong>.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Your software engineer can control which WordPress-specific metrics your app sends to New Relic by using the PHP agent's <code>ini</code> setting <code>newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks</code>. This is enabled by default in versions <strong>5.3</strong> or higher, and it can be disabled with:</p>
<pre><code>newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false
</code></pre>
<p>Although this setting uses the word <code>.hooks</code>, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes.</p>
<h2>Metrics</h2>
<p>The PHP agent receives metrics for the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hooks</strong>: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions <code>apply_filters</code>, <code>apply_filters_ref_array</code>, <code>do_action</code>, and <code>do_action_ref_array</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Plugins and themes</strong>: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Integration with New Relic partners [#integration]</h2>
<p>By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's <strong>Administration</strong> page. For example, <a href="http://newrelic.com/connect/details#w3-total-cache">W3 Total Cache</a> is one of New Relic's <a href="/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/new-relic-products-features/new-relic-connect">Connect partners</a> that specializes in WordPress apps.</p>
<h2>WordPress plugin for browser monitoring [#browser]</h2>
<p>Signing up for a New Relic account and adding <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser">browser monitoring</a> to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rt-newrelic-browser/">browser monitoring plugin for WordPress</a>. The plugin and our browser monitoring do not require the special access required to install our PHP agent.</p>
<p>This makes them generally compatible with <strong>all</strong> WordPress hosting providers. In addition, the WordPress plugin is supported by the authors and the WordPress community.</p>
