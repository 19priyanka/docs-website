<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>You installed the New Relic PHP agent and generated some traffic, but the agent does not send the first transaction.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>This is expected behavior. When the <a href="/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/new-relic-daemon-processes">PHP daemon</a> is in its initial state, <strong>two</strong> transactions must occur before it will start reporting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With the first transaction, the PHP daemon adds your newly-reporting application to its own application information table.</li>
  <li>Once the application is added, the PHP daemon reports the second transaction to New Relic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Run a trivial php process, such as <code>phpinfo()</code>, before running the processes you want reported.</p>
<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>This is expected behavior by the PHP daemon, which initially requires two transactions to be reported.</p>
