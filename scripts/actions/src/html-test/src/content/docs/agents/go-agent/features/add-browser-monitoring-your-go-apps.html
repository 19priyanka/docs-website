<p>If you installed New Relic's Go agent for your app, you can also use <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser">browser monitoring</a> to monitor browser performance. To install the browser agent, use the <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#copy-paste-app">copy and paste method</a>, or use the Go agent API.</p>
<h2>Install with Go agent Browser API [#go-browser-api]</h2>
<p>To enable support for browser monitoring, your HTML pages must include a JavaScript snippet that will load the browser agent and configure it with the correct application name. This snippet is available with the <code>Transaction.BrowserTimingHeader</code> method. Support for browser monitoring's timing headers is available with <a href="/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes">Go agent versions 2.5.0 or higher</a>.</p>
<p>Include the byte slice returned by <code>Transaction.BrowserTimingHeader().WithTags()</code> as early as possible in the <code>&#x3C;head></code> section of your HTML and after any <code>&#x3C;meta charset></code> tags.</p>
<p>The JavaScript returned from <code>Transaction.BrowserTimingHeader</code> is request-specific. That is why it must be called on each request.</p>
<pre><code>func indexHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    io.WriteString(w, "&#x3C;html>&#x3C;head>")

    // The New Relic browser javascript should be placed as high in the
    // HTML as possible. We suggest including it immediately after the
    // opening &#x3C;head> tag and any &#x3C;meta charset> tags.
    txn := newrelic.FromContext(req.Context())
    hdr := txn.BrowserTimingHeader()
    // BrowserTimingHeader() will always return a header whose methods can
    // be safely called.
    if js := hdr.WithTags(); js != nil {
        w.Write(js)
    }
    
    io.WriteString(w, "&#x3C;/head>&#x3C;body>browser header page&#x3C;/body>&#x3C;/html>")
}
</code></pre>
