  <p>The mobile <strong>Maps</strong> UI will be deprecated on December 22, 2020. <a href="/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/introduction-service-maps">Service maps</a> are available in New Relic One's left navigation for each mobile entity, and they are a better way to visualize and customize representations of your architecture. For more information, see our <a href="https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-across-browser-php-python-mobile-and-android-agents/123951">Explorers Hub post</a>.</p>

<p>Maps help you find performance problems for a mobile app or its services. This gives you a clear picture of your app's relationships to other services and the influence of each service on the others. If one service fails, you can see at a glance which other services are affected.</p>
<h2>View a map of your mobile app services [#map_procedures]</h2>
<p>To view your mobile app and its related services as an architectural map, go to <strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a> > Mobile > (select a mobile app) > Monitor > Service map</strong>. For more information, see the <a href="/docs/understand-dependencies/understand-system-dependencies/service-maps/how-use-service-maps">service maps documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to use the deprecated mobile <strong>Map</strong> page, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong><a href="https://rpm.newrelic.com/mobile">rpm.newrelic.com/mobile</a> > (select an app) > Network > Map</strong>.</li>
  <li>To view <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring-ui/http-requests-dashboard">HTTP request details</a> for a service, select its name.</li>
  <li>To view details for <a href="/docs/applications-menu/applications-overview">an app monitored by APM</a> that is related to the service, select the service's name below the associated hostname.</li>
  <li>To view throughput details as a chart, select the icon or the <code>cpm</code> bar below the service's name.</li>
  <li>To view detailed metrics for a service, mouse over the throughput chart.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>Map</strong> page for Mobile monitoring gives an architectural view of your mobile app and the services it uses,</p>
