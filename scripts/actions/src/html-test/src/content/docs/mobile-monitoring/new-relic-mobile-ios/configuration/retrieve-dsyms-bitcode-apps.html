<p>Bitcode is a feature that gives Apple the ability to re-compile iOS and tvOS applications for specific users' hardware. This provides a smaller download size for end users. For more about this process, see Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html">Bitcode and app thinning documentation</a>.</p>
<p>When Apple compiles an app, the dSYM files are also compiled. For New Relic to be able to symbolicate crashes of your Bitcode-enabled app, these dSYM files need to be downloaded from Apple and then uploaded to New Relic.</p>
<h2>Identify missing dSYMs [#IdentifyingMissingdSYMs]</h2>
<p>When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/ios-agent-crash-reporting">mobile crash reports</a> to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to <a href="#Archive">find the archive and download dSYMs</a>.</p>
<p>If an app is missing a dSYM file, three indicators are available in the New Relic Mobile UI:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Banner notification</strong>: A banner warning appears on the <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/crashes/mobile-apps-crash-report-dashboard"><strong>Crash report</strong> page</a>. The warning reads:</p>
    <pre><code>We were unable to locate your dsym.
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Upload prompt</strong>: from the <strong>Crash type summary</strong> page you will be automatically prompted to <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/upload-dsyms-bitcode-apps#mobile-ui">upload a dSYM file</a> if it is missing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Machine code</strong>: The crash stack trace on the <strong>Crash report</strong> page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Download dSYM files using iTunes Connect [#iTunes]</h2>
<p>To download the dSYM files you need for your app:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to Apple <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/login">iTunes Connect</a>.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>My Apps > (selected app) > Activity</strong>.</li>
  <li>From the list of builds for your application, select the build number you need for the dSYM.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Download dSYM</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, to upload the resulting zip file directly to New Relic:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Follow the instructions to <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/upload-dsyms-bitcode-apps#manual-dsym">manually upload dSYM</a>, and skip step 1.</li>
  <li>Unpack one dSYM contained in this zip file to retrieve a build UUID that you can upload. (Follow the last step in the manual upload instructions.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once New Relic receives the zip file, the build UUIDs for all other dSYMs contained in that zip file will be identified.</p>
<h2>Download dSYM files using Xcode's app archive [#Archive]</h2>
<p>Use the <a href="#identifyingAppVersion">app version and build number</a> to identify the applicable app archive in the Xcode <strong>Organizer</strong> and download the dSYMs.</p>
<p>
  <img src="./images/screen-dsym2.png" alt="Download dSYMs for mobile app version/build" title="Download dSYMs for mobile app version/build">
</p>
<p><strong>Using Xcode to download dSYMs:</strong> From the <strong>Archives</strong> tab, select the app and version/build, then select <strong>Download dSYMs</strong>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Xcode <strong>Organizer</strong>: From the <strong>Xcode</strong> menu, select <strong>Window > Organizer > Archives > (select a mobile app)</strong>.</li>
  <li>From <strong>Version</strong>, select the archive that matches the app version (listed first) and build number (following the app version in parentheses).</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Download dSYMs</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The dSYMs will be downloaded from Apple if available and if the file names contain a series of letters and numbers. If the dSYM files are named after the the dependencies in your project, the download will not be successful.</p>
<h2>Upload dSYMs [#Upload-dSYMs]</h2>
<p>Once you have located the dSYMs, follow the instructions to <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/upload-dsyms-bitcode-apps">upload a dSYM</a> for each zipped dSYM.</p>
