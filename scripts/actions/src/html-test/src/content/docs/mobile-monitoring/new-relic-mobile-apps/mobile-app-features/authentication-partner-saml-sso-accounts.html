<p>Partner account users typically use SAML-SSO to sign in through your New Relic partner site. You may not have separate passwords or authentication information for your New Relic account.</p>
<p>If you use an email address associated with a New Relic partner account when you first sign in to the New Relic mobile app, New Relic will send you a confirmation email for authentication. Android app users will also see a notification message.</p>
