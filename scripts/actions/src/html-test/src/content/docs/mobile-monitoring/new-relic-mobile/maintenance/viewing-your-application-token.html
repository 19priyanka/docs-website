<p>New Relic's mobile monitoring automatically assigns a unique, 40-character hexadecimal string to each mobile app you monitor, for both the US and EU datacenter. This application token is similar to a New Relic license key and is required to authenticate your app's data.</p>
<p>To view your application token:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://one.newrelic.com/">one.newrelic.com</a>, click <strong>Mobile</strong>, and select a monitored app.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Application</strong> or <strong>Installation</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p>Data reported from your mobile app is tied to a named app based on the application token. All apps with a single application token will report to the same place in our mobile monitoring UI, regardless of the app's name when installed on a mobile device. We recommend using a different application token for each platform to separate iOS and Android versions.</p>
