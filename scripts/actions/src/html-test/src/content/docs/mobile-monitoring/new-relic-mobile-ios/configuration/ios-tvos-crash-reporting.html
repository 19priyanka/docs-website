<p>For Mobile version 4 or higher, New Relic produces crash reports for your mobile applications. When an iOS or tvOS application crashes, the operating system creates a crash report and stores it on the device. New Relic uploads this report the next time the app launches.</p>
<p>Using this report and any relevant dSYM files, the crash report includes the complete stack trace with human-readable information. You can then log into New Relic and see each crash, including the method and line where it crashed, plus device and environment details.</p>
<h2>dSYM files [#about-dsym]</h2>
<p>When you create a release build of an iOS or tvOS application, the names of methods and classes are stripped, leaving only machine-readable memory addresses. When the application crashes, the stack trace consists of this machine-readable code.</p>
<p>A <strong>dSYM file</strong> is an Xcode project file for <strong>debug symbols</strong>. It contains the debugging symbols that allow for translation of the initial crash report to human-readable information. This process is known as symbolication.</p>
<p>New Relic has dynamic framework support for dSYM uploading. If your app uses a dynamic framework with multiple dSYM files, New Relic automatically uploads and uses those files.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/retrieve-upload-dsyms">Retrieve and download dSYMs</a> or <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/upload-dsyms-bitcode-apps">Upload dSYM files</a>.</p>
<h2>Debug the crash reporter [#debugging]</h2>
<p>Crash reporting is enabled by default, but there are some circumstances where it will be disabled:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If the debugger is enabled:</strong> There can only be one uncaught exception handler registered at a time per application. If running with the debugger attached, New Relic will not capture and report crashes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If another crash reporter is enabled:</strong> If another uncaught exception handler is registered after New Relic starts, this error message is logged:</p>
    <pre><code>The New Relic exception handler has been replaced. 
This may result in crashes no longer reporting to New Relic.
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
