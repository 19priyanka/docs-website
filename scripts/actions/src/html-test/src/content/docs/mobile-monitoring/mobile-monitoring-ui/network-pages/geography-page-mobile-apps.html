<p>The Geography page shows your mobile users' experience as a world view, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Color-coded response times</li>
  <li>Network requests (calls per minute)</li>
  <li>Data transfer size</li>
  <li>Active devices</li>
  <li>Network failure rates</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also drill down to detailed information about each country.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Geography</strong> feature is not the same as the <strong>Map</strong> feature. The <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/map-page-mobile-apps"><strong>Map</strong> page</a> shows an architectural view of the relationship between a mobile app and its related services.</p>
</div>
