<p>New Relic Mobile includes a monthly report with a bar chart tracking the number of devices running your app for each month over the last year. To view the report: Go to <strong><a href="https://rpm.newrelic.com/mobile">rpm.newrelic.com/mobile</a> > (select an app) > Usage > Monthly uniques</strong>.</p>
<h2>Monthly uniques report details [#details]</h2>
<p>To see the total number of unique devices for any month, mouse over the month's bar in the chart. The current month's device count is a month-to-date value and does not indicate the full month's usage.</p>

<p>Use any of New Relic's standard <a href="/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/new-relic-user-interface">user interface functions</a> and <a href="/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/standard-dashboard-features">page functions</a> to drill down into detailed information.</p>
<p>Unique users are used to calculate your <a href="/docs/accounts/new-relic-account-usage/mobile-usage/mobile-subscription-usage-ui">monthly usage</a>, which is used to calculate your subscription level.</p>
<h2>Device tracking [#tracking]</h2>
<p>New Relic Mobile does not use hardware identifiers for unique install tracking.</p>
<ul>
  <li>On iOS we use the IdentifierForVendor property. (Versions 5.3.4 and lower used the SecureUDID library.)</li>
  <li>On Android we generate a unique GUID when the application is installed.</li>
</ul>
