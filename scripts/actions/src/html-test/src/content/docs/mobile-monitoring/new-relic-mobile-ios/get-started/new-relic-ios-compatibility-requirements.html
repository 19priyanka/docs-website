<p>New Relic Mobile for iOS is compliant with standard application stores, including Apple App Store, Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, and others. Before you <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/ios-installation-configuration">install and configure</a> New Relic Mobile functionality with your mobile applications, follow these guidelines for compatibility and other requirements.</p>
<h2>Foreground monitoring [#foreground]</h2>

<h2>Testing is not supported [#testing]</h2>
<p>Our Mobile agents are designed and tested to work in a normal app lifecycle. New Relic does not support running any testing environment on applications with the agent. Testing can cause conflicts and unpredictable behavior.</p>
<h2>Potential method replacement conflicts [#method]</h2>
<p>Our iOS agent utilizes method replacement during run time. This may result in a conflict with other libraries that also implement method replacement, such as ReactiveCocoa, Aspects, and AppleGuice.</p>
