<p>With the fourth major version of the iOS agent, New Relic Mobile includes crash reporting. This new feature changes the standard installation procedures, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A post build script is required to upload dSYMs so that crash reports can be properly interpreted.</li>
  <li>An additional framework (<strong>libc++.dylib</strong>) must be added to projects including New Relic.</li>
</ul>
