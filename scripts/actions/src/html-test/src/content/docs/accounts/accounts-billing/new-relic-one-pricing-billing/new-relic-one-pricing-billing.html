<h2>How the New Relic One pricing plan works [#how-pricing-works]</h2>
<p>Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call <strong>New Relic One pricing</strong>. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to <a href="/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-to-transition">transition to this pricing</a>.</p>
<p>For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The pricing tier (Standard, Pro, Enterprise). Higher pricing tiers give access to more account-related admin features, more support, longer data retention, and other features (<a href="https://newrelic.com/pricing">learn more</a>).</li>
  <li>The number of <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type">full users</a> (users with access to everything available at that tier). <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type">Basic users</a> are free. Standard tier includes one full user for free, and a max of five.</li>
  <li>The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that.</li>
  <li>For <a href="https://newrelic.com/pricing">Applied Intelligence</a>, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of events above the free included amount. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.)</li>
</ul>

  <p>Note that this pricing plan allows you to have an entirely free Standard tier account with one <a href="/docs/users-roles#user-type">full user</a> and multiple <a href="/docs/users-roles#user-type">basic users</a>, provided you're okay with the free included limits.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Billing calculation details [#calculation-details]</h2>
<p>For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed <a href="#billing-usage-ui">in the UI</a>. Here are some more details about how billing works:</p>
<div data-component="CollapserGroup" data-prop="W10=">
  <div data-component="Collapser" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJpZCIsInZhbHVlIjoidXNhZ2UtY2FsY3VsYXRpb24ifSx7InR5cGUiOiJtZHhBdHRyaWJ1dGUiLCJuYW1lIjoidGl0bGUiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6IkRhdGEgdXNhZ2UgY2FsY3VsYXRpb24ifV0=">
    <div data-prop-text="title">Data usage calculation</div>
    <p>One <a href="#how-pricing-works">pricing</a> factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the <a href="#billing-usage-ui">usage UI</a>.</p>
    <p>Other calculation details:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs.</p>
        <p>For more on how data is ingested, see <a href="/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic">Manage data ingest</a>.</p>
        <p>For how to query usage, see <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/usage-queries-alerts">Query and alert on usage</a>.</p>

    <div data-prop-text="title">User count</div>
    <p>For accounts on <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing">New Relic One pricing</a>, one billing factor is the monthly count of <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type">full users</a>, which you can see tracked <a href="#billing-usage-ui">in the UI</a>.</p>
    <p>Here's an overview of how the monthly full user count is calculated:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The end-of-month full user count is based on an hourly resolution. For example, if a user was a full user for 180 hours out of a 30-day month (720 hours), that would be counted as 0.25 full users towards the total count.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Next, that end-of-month full user count is rounded to the nearest integer. For example, if the end-of-month full user count is 4.5, that account has 5 billable full users. If the end-of-month full user count is 4.45, that account has 4 billable full users.</p>
        <p>Other calculation details:</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The <a href="https://newrelic.com/pricing">Standard tier</a> includes one free full user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If an organization transitioned from our original pricing plan to the New Relic One pricing plan, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In that case, that user counts as a full user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For organizations that have a master/sub-account structure, the billable users are counted on the main account responsible for payment. This can mean that if you’re viewing or querying your user count when in a sub-account, you won’t see the complete user count for that organization.</p>

    <div data-prop-text="title">Billing periods</div>
    <p>For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked <a href="#billing-usage-ui">in the UI</a>.</p>
    <p>When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month.</p>
    <p>For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill.</p>
