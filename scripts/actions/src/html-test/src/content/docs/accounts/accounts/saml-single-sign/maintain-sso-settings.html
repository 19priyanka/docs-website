  <p>These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our <a href="/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-pricing-users-relate">original user model</a>. For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso">Authentication domains</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>After your SAML SSO login is configured, tested, and enabled, all of your New Relic account users (including the account Owner and Admins) must use your organization's SSO URL to sign in to New Relic. Their email address must match what has been set up in New Relic. Also, their ability to use the SSO URL to access applications other than New Relic will depend on their permissions set in those applications.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts/saml-single-sign/saml-service-providers#requirements">Requirements</a>.</p>
