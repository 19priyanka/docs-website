<p>New Relic applies appropriate taxes to your New Relic account based on your organization's billing location and tax status.</p>
<h2>Sales tax [#taxes]</h2>
<p>Some jurisdictions require taxes to be collected on Software as a Service (SaaS) products. New Relic complies with such requirements if we maintain a nexus (presence) in the applicable jurisdiction. In accordance with such laws, New Relic will collect and remit sales tax to the appropriate agency. As of February 2013, all customers in those jurisdictions see a sales tax line item in their <a href="/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/invoices-receipts">credit card charges or invoices</a>.</p>
