<p>Some tips for understanding New Relic account/user structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At the top level of New Relic's account hierarchy is the concept of the "organization." A New Relic customer's group of related accounts are considered to be inside a single "New Relic organization."</li>
  <li>For accounts with <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing">New Relic One pricing</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>The Standard <a href="https://newrelic.com/pricing">pricing tier</a> allows for a single account per organization. The Pro and Enterprise pricing tiers allows <a href="/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts">master/sub-account structures</a> within an organization.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New Relic offers you a view of data from across accounts in the same organization. For more details, see <a href="/docs/factors-affecting-access-features-data#account-access">Access to features and data</a>.</li>
  <li>Some organizations can have <a href="/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts">master/sub-account structures</a>.</li>
  <li>Billing-related usage is calculated at the level of the organization. This can mean that usage data may not display organization-level usage when viewed at a sub-account level.</li>
</ul>
