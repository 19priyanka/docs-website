<p>New Relic lets you set up automated user provisioning (AUM), which allows you to import, update, and deactivate your New Relic users from your identity provider, without having to use a New Relic UI or API. With this automated provisioning, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Requirements and compatibility:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requires Enterprise tier.</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models">User model</a>-related requirements:
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to access the <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso#source-users">authentication domain UI</a>, you must be on our <a href="/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models">New Relic One user model</a> and have <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model#standard-roles">user management roles</a> (<strong>Organization manager</strong> and <strong>Authentication domain manager</strong>) assigned. If you're on our <a href="/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models">original user model</a> (or otherwise can't access this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative.</li>
      <li>AUM creates users on our <a href="/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models">New Relic One user model</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supports SCIM 2.0 standard.</li>
  <li>Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO).</li>
  <li>Supported identity providers: Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview of process [#overview]</h2>
<p>Setting up automated user management can vary depending on setup but will likely involve three steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you require multiple New Relic accounts, you'll likely need the help of your New Relic account representative (not New Relic tech support) to set up those accounts.</li>
  <li>Configuring your identity provider using the tips in one of our relevant guides (Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin).</li>
  <li>Enabling SCIM and SAML SSO settings in the <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso">authentication domain UI</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The steps below will walk you through these in more detail.</p>
<h2>1. Getting started with New Relic help [#getting-started]</h2>
<p>When you reach out to your New Relic account representative, they'll need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your organization name</li>
  <li>List of New Relic <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id">account IDs</a> to associate with the organization</li>
</ul>
<p>With this information, your account representative creates an organization record for you in our new system and associates your accounts to the organization. They will provide you with the following information which you will need to configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application for your identity provider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authentication domain ID</li>
  <li>SCIM bearer token</li>
</ul>
<p>The SCIM bearer token allows the provisioning of your New Relic users, so please keep the value secure. Your account representative will transfer the SCIM bearer token to you in a secure manner.</p>
<h2>2. Configure SCIM/SSO application [#configure-application]</h2>
<p>Refer to the relevant identity-provider-specific guide to see details about configuring the New Relic SCIM/SSO application for your identity provider:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/azure-scimsso-application-configuration">Azure AD</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/okta-scimsso-application-configuration">Okta</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/onelogin-scimsso-application-configuration">OneLogin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't use one of these providers, you can also <a href="/docs/scim-support-automated-user-management">set up SCIM using our APIs</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Configure SSO and group capabilities [#configure-sso]</h2>
<p>Next you can complete the necessary <strong>Sources of users</strong> and <strong>Authentication</strong> information in the <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso">New Relic UI</a>.</p>
<p>On the New Relic side, there are <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#standard-roles">several standard roles</a> that define New Relic user capabilities. For each of the user groups you send to New Relic, you need to specify the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which of the New Relic roles to assign to the user group.</li>
  <li>The list of account IDs for the accounts to which members of the user group should have access.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an example of how this would work if you were getting New Relic assistance: if your identity provider has a user group called "Normal User" that you use to group your normal users and these users should have access to your accounts with IDs 1000001, 1000002, and 1000003, you might ask your account representative, "Can you please map our identity provider group "Normal user" to the New Relic role "standard_user". Members of that group can access our New Relic accounts with IDs 1000001, 1000002 and 1000003."</p>
<h2>4. Assign users [#add-users]</h2>
<p>With the above configuration completed, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to use. Assigning the application to a user will cause the user to be provisioned at New Relic. After being provisioned, the user can click on the New Relic SCIM/SSO application tile on their identity provider home page to be logged into New Relic. Refer to the identity-provider-specific guide for more details about how to assign the application to a user:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/azure-scimsso-application-configuration">Azure AD</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/okta-scimsso-application-configuration">Okta</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/onelogin-scimsso-application-configuration">OneLogin</a></li>

  <p>Set a time zone for your users. If not specified, our UI will show date/times with the UTC time zone. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the "Olson" time zone database format (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles"). For details about how to set a time zone for a user, refer to the identity provider's documentation.</p>
