<p>For all headings and document titles, use <a href="/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/capitalization#heading_caps">sentence case</a>.</p>
<h2>Use parallel construction [#parallel]</h2>
<p>Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns ("Organization," "Tone"), all verbs ("Create," "Delete"), etc.</p>
<h2>Keep it short, avoid -ing words [#short-gerunds]</h2>
<p>For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: <code>Install the agent</code>, for example, rather than <code>Agent installation</code>. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity.</p>
<h2>Do not use h1 headings [#h1_headings]</h2>
<p>After you publish your doc, the Docs site will automatically use what you added to the <strong>Title</strong> field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings.</p>
<p>If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, notify the <code>@hero</code> in the <a href="https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/C0DSGL3FZ/">#documentation</a> Slack channel. (You must have admin privileges to maintain a doc's <strong>Short title</strong> field.)</p>
<h2>Use h2 headings to identify chunks of information [#h2_identify]</h2>
<p>Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (<code>h2</code>). For example:</p>
<pre><code>&#x3C;h2 id="create-new-user">Create a new user&#x3C;/h2>
</code></pre>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJpbXBvcnRhbnQifV0=">
  <p>Assign an ID to every h2, h3, and collapser in the document. If your ID has more than one word, use hyphens <code>-</code> between the words, not spaces or underscores. For example: <code>&#x3C;h2 id="install-apm">Install the APM agent&#x3C;h2></code>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you have too many h2 sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages.</p>
<h2>Avoid using h3 headings [#h3]</h2>
<p>Avoid using h3 headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about h3s that make an h2 section longer than a single screen height.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of good scenarios for using h3s:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Example #1: <a href="/docs/introduction-events-metrics-api#operations">Events-to-metrics API doc</a></li>
  <li>Example #2: <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/mysql-monitoring-integration#metrics">Infrastructure integration doc</a></li>
</ul>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p>By default, h3s don't show up in the sidebar table of contents. To include them, include a <code>class="freq-link"</code> inside the h3:</p>
  <pre><code>&#x3C;h3 id="configure-fred" class="freq-link">Configure with Fred&#x3C;/h3>
</code></pre>
</div>
