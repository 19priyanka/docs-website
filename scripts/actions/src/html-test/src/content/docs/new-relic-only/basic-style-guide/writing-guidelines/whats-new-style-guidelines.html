<p>This document describes how to create What's New content for New Relic One.</p>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p>The What's New content is created by the Product Marketing Management (PMM) team.</p>
  <p>Technical writers are available to review the new content, help with the logistics and timing around publishing, and let PMMs know when an upcoming feature might warrant a What's New post.</p>
</div>
<h2>What it is [#what]</h2>

<p>From <a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a>, click your account dropdown, then click <strong>What's New</strong></p>
<p>Written by the Product Marketing Management team, What's New posts are a way to highlight new product features that might otherwise be missed.</p>
<p>To see What's New, go to <a href="https://one.newrelic.com"><strong>one.newrelic.com</strong></a>, click your account dropdown, and then click <strong>What's New</strong>. The same info also appears on the docs site at <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new">docs.newrelic.com/whats-new</a>. The docs site is the source of truth, and updating or adding a post to the docs site automatically updates the UI.</p>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p>What's New posts aren't replacing release notes or technical product deep-dives in our blog posts and community forums. What's New will actively promote those posts and resources.</p>
</div>
<h2>Why it matters [#why]</h2>
<p>What's New content is a way for Product Marketing Management (PMM) to create a carefullly curated channel of timely, high-level announcements of major features.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, our customers don't know about all the great work we've been doing. What's New is a way to make this product information visible directly from the product as new features are released.</p>
<p>In addition, What's New will be used for monthly and quarterly feature summary posts, also hosted in New Relic One.</p>
<h2>Get started</h2>
<p>If you have an idea for a What's New post, reach out to the relevant PMM.</p>
<p>For the current PMM organizational chart, go <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nou_BJ23_J-eNxu-4cJOR1bYC62Q62dwxPppo5Cr0V0/edit#slide=id.g6d3871dfda_6_0">here</a>. (New Relic only)</p>
<h2>What's New text fields</h2>
<p>The What's New template has some unique fields. Read on to learn more about how to use them and how they map to the UI.</p>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>The title field is how your readers will browse through What's New and find what interests them.</p>
<p>Make your titles as short as possible and include the most relevant product and feature names. The more specific you get, the more likely people will be to read the post.</p>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p>Please use sentence case for titles.</p>
  <p>For example, <code>New Relic Browser launches full support for Googleâ€™s Core Web Vitals and W3C trace context</code>.</p>
</div>
<h3>Released on [#release-date]</h3>
<p>The date a feature is released.</p>
<p>What's New posts are organized chronologically. This controls where a post will show on the list. If you have two or more posts on the same date, use the time field to control the post order.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A brief description of the feature that appears directly under the title in the left sidebar and at the top of the post.</p>
<p>Make sure your summary is a single sentence and isn't more than about 10-20 words.</p>
<h3>Learn more and Get started links [#links]</h3>
<p>Learn more links are used to highlight blog posts or other marketing material that provides more information about the feature.</p>
<p>Get started links are used to link to related documentation.</p>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p>These links are optional, but we strongly suggest you include them. If your post has done its job, your readers will want to learn more or see the feature in action.</p>
</div>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJpbXBvcnRhbnQifV0=">
  <p>Make sure to use full URLs. Relative URLs to the Docs site won't work from New Relic One.</p>
</div>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>The body is where you can tell the story about your new feature. Each What's New post should be between <strong>150-400</strong> words.</p>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p>If possible, include one or more screenshots or a video.</p>
</div>
<p>The goal of the What's New post is to inform people about the feature. Here are some questions to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the most important idea to communicate about this feature?</li>
  <li>What problem does this feature solve?</li>
  <li>How does it make using New Relic easier?</li>
  <li>What's delightful about it?</li>
  <li>Can you add a great, visually appealing screenshot or video?</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't include procedural how-to content. Use the Get started and Learn more links to link to information about how to use the feature.</p>
