<p>Use this checklist for Tech Docs team peer edits as well as for hero edit requests.</p>
<h2>Title</h2>
<p>Check that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The doc's title effectively describes the contents.</li>
  <li>Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, <code>Install</code> not <code>Installing</code>.</li>
  <li>The short title is consistent with others in the sidebar.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Introduction [#intro]</h2>
<p>Check that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they have found the relevant doc.</li>
  <li>It provides a concise roadmap to the doc's contents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Headings (H2s) [#headings]</h2>
<p>Check that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want.</li>
  <li>Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the <code>ing</code> verb form.</li>
  <li>Text for the H2 section does not span beyond a computer screen's height.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p>Check that the text:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Optimizes for easier translation: Avoids idioms, slang, etc.</li>
  <li>Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters.</li>
  <li>Includes <a href="/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/usage-dictionary#ui-path">hyperlinks in UI paths</a>.</li>
  <li>Has no typos.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedures</h2>
<p>Procedures use active voice and focus on steps ("do this"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures.</li>
  <li>If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc.</li>
  <li>If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example: What not to do and what to do instead</strong></p>
<p>Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>The original tech writer or Docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that are not addressed within the doc or its cross references.</p>

        <p>For <a href="/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/screenshots-images">screenshots and images</a>, check that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Full size always have captions to explain their relevance.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions.</p>
            <p>In addition, for hero edits, make sure that screenshots and images follow the <a href="https://newrelic.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-8362">Docs site's security guidelines</a>.</p>
