<p>This doc will explain required styles and recommended phrasings for user-related terminology.</p>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJpbXBvcnRhbnQifV0=">
  <p>Note that this style guide applies to the <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles">New Relic One user model</a>, not the <a href="/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles">original user model</a>. Even though some similar terms are used (e.g., <strong>Admin</strong>), this is an entirely different user model with a very different structure, recommended phrasings, and style. To understand user model differences, see <a href="/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model">Pricing and user changes</a>.</p>

<h2>Styles and formatting [#styles]</h2>
<p>Here are some user-related styles and formats:</p>
<div data-component="Table" data-prop="W10=">

      <div>
        <p><a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type">User type</a> (basic user vs full user)</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>"If you’re a full user..."</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Lower case, no style.</p>
        <p>Note that it can sometimes be awkward when "basic user" is in front of a noun. For example: "To learn about basic user capabilities..." can sound like you're talking about user capabilities that are basic. To avoid this, rephrase to be more clear and/or link to <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type">User type</a> from "basic user" or "full user."</p>

<h2>Language requirements and recommendations [#recommendations]</h2>
<h3>General philosophy for user-permission language [#general-approach]</h3>
<p>Our general philosophy is summed up in these points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there is a specific, single <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles">standard role</a> required to use a feature/functionality, explain that in a requirements section so that customers will understand what user role they need to use that feature. This approach means that our user-related restriction mentions will be quite infrequent, as there are only a few features that are gated by a specific standard role. For language tips on this, see <a href="#required-role">User role permissions</a>.</li>
  <li>We do not explain restrictions related to user type (basic vs full) or default user groups (<strong>Admin</strong> and <strong>User</strong>). All restrictions related to users come down to the role: the user type and default user group are just ways that the standard user roles are restricted.</li>
  <li>We sometimes get requests to add restrictions related to user type (e.g., "This feature requires you to be a full user"), but we do not do this. The reason is because we document what is available to full users and basic users in the primary user docs, and because any full user vs basic user limitations are due to standard roles (full users have theoretical access to all roles, while basic users have the <strong>All product admin</strong> standard role but without Full-Stack Observability access). Our docs would be crowded all over with explanations about full/basic users if we took this approaach, so we only document role restrictions.</li>
  <li>For API docs, we should document any user type or user role-related API restrictions in a single API requirements section, if possible, and not put user restrictions in multiple API docs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>User role language [#required-role]</h3>
<p>We sometimes must call out that a feature requires a specific <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles">standard role</a>. This would be one of the standard roles that includes unique capabilities that can’t be replicated with a custom role, like <strong>Billing user</strong> and <strong>Organization manager</strong>. Here’s the recommended phrasing for this: "This requires the <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles"><strong>Billing user</strong> role</a>."</p>
<p>This phrasing is meant to cover all cases where a user is in a group that has that role, whether that group is a default group (<strong>Admin</strong> or <strong>User</strong>: <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#group-roles">learn the standard roles these groups have</a>) or a custom group that has had that role assigned. The link to the standard roles docs section (shown in example above) should provide that context if a reader is confused.</p>
<p>To see an example of this phrasing in a doc, see this <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains">requirements section</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's necessary to explain how access works for users on both user models. This should be less and less required over time because a) customers will be converging on the new pricing plan and new user model and b) existing customers’ users were given broad access to the platform for a while before user-related restrictions were instituted. But if this is deemed required, you can explain this using this approach:</p>
<p>User role requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users on <a href="/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles">original user model</a>: the <strong>Data retention manager</strong> role.</li>
  <li>Users on <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles">New Relic One user model</a>: the <a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles"><strong>Billing user</strong> role</a>.</li>
</ul>
