<p>Decisions about translation are important whenever you work on new feature documentation or make significant improvements to existing documentation. We encourage you to review the <a href="/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/docs-translation#request-translation">translation approval criteria in the Docs site's style guide</a>, and to consider whether your work is a good candidate for translation. (We do not translate release notes, data dictionary values, hidden docs, or docs in private beta or limited release.)</p>
<p>The procedures in this doc explain several translation scenarios and are intended for tech writer use only. If you are not a tech writer and have questions about requesting a doc for translation, contact <code>@hero</code> in the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T02D34WJD/C0DSGL3FZ">#documentation Slack channel</a>.</p>
<h2>Translation project background [#project]</h2>
<p>All of the New Relic documentation that exists on our English docs site (<a href="https://docs.newrelic.com">docs.newrelic.com</a>) also exists on our Japanese docs site (<a href="https://docs.newrelic.co.jp">docs.newrelic.co.jp</a>). However, not all of the docs have been translated into Japanese on that site.</p>
<p>An initial set of key docs on the Docs site was translated into Japanese during 2018, and requests for new or existing docs have continued since then. In addition, sets of 200 core docs have been identified for translation projects in any language, such as French and German.</p>
<p>
  <img src="./images/translation-info.png" alt="Drupal edit mode: Translation info section" title="Drupal edit mode: Translation info section">
</p>
<p>In Drupal <strong>Edit</strong> mode, every doc's <strong>Translation info</strong> section indicates its current status for translation.</p>
<p>For more information about translated docs (including toggling between the two sites, viewing the translation status, selecting translation criteria, and getting data about translated docs), see the <a href="/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/docs-translation">Docs translation documentation in the style guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Clone an existing doc [#clone-translation]</h2>
<p>Any time you clone an existing doc, always do the following. This applies whether or not you want to request your new (cloned) doc for translation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Always check whether the doc you are cloning has already been translated. Either search the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/admin/workbench/translation-index">Translation index in Drupal</a> for any docs, or view the <strong>Translation info</strong> section in the doc you are cloning.</li>
  <li>If the doc that you are cloning has already been translated, be sure to clear the <strong>Translation info</strong> fields in the new doc before you save it.</li>
  <li>If you want to request the new (cloned) doc to be translated, continue with the procedure to <a href="#new-translation">request a new doc to be translated</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Request a new doc to be translated [#new-translation]</h2>
<p>This procedure is for GA docs with full URLs on the Docs site. We do not translate release notes, data dictionary values, hidden docs, or docs in private beta or limited release.</p>
<p>If you are writing a new doc, or if you are the Tech Docs liaison for a new feature with multiple important new docs, follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/docs-translation#request-translation">translation criteria</a> to evaluate whether there is a good business case to translate the doc. If yes, continue. If no, stop here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Drupal: Edit the doc you want to have translated, and scroll to the doc's <strong>Translation info</strong> section:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Target languages:</strong> <code>Japanese</code></li>
      <li><strong>Translation status:</strong> <code>Wish listed</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Drupal: Scroll to the bottom of the doc, make the following changes, then save as <strong>Published</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>URL path settings:</strong> Make sure <strong>Generate automatic URL alias</strong> is checked.</li>
      <li><strong>Moderation notes:</strong> Note your Jira, and then use Keyboard Maestro's <code>kkcriteria</code> to identify the translation criteria you used with your PM or stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liaison: Based on your conversation with your PM and stakeholders, add the docs to your <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CjFl1_FpzW47KbGVeLynlQ4mZ9KERV4R2OdxWOSYRiY/edit#gid=1415803267">Docs liaison spreadsheet's <strong>Translation Impact</strong> tab</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The translation team then uses the doc's <code>For quote</code> status to prioritize and get budget approval to translate. When translation is completed, the doc's status is updated to <code>Completed</code>.</p>
<h2>Request an existing doc to be translated [#existing-translation]</h2>
<p>This procedure is for GA docs with full URLs on the Docs site. We do not translate release notes, data dictionary values, hidden docs, or docs in private beta or limited release.</p>
<p>If you want to flag an existing doc for translation, follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/docs-translation#request-translation">translation criteria</a> to evaluate whether there is a good business case to translate the doc. If yes, continue. If no, stop here.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Target languages:</strong> <code>Japanese</code></li>
      <li><strong>Translation status:</strong> <code>Wish listed</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Drupal: Scroll to the bottom of the doc, make the following changes, then save as <strong>Published</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>URL path settings:</strong> Make sure <strong>Generate automatic URL alias</strong> is checked.</li>
      <li><strong>Moderation notes:</strong> Note your Jira, and then use Keyboard Maestro's <code>kkcriteria</code> to identify the translation criteria you used with your PM or stakeholders.</li>

  </li>
</ol>
<p>The translation team then uses the doc's <code>For quote</code> status to prioritize and get budget approval to translate. When translation is completed, the doc's status is updated to <code>Completed</code>.</p>
<h2>Merge an existing translated doc into an untranslated doc [#merge-translated]</h2>
<p>This procedure is for GA docs with full URLs on the Docs site. We do not translate release notes, data dictionary values, hidden docs, or docs in private beta or limited release.</p>
<p>If you merge an existing translated doc into a new or existing doc that has not been translated, follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In your Jira comments: Before you delete and redirect the existing translated doc into the other doc, note the full URL of the translated doc and the full URL of the doc where it will be merged. Tag Julien Mira in your Jira.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Drupal: Edit the doc you now want to request for translation, and scroll to the doc's <strong>Translation info</strong> section:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Target languages:</strong> <code>Japanese</code></li>
      <li><strong>Translation status:</strong> <code>Wish listed</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Drupal: Scroll to the bottom of the doc, make the following changes, then save as <strong>Published</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>URL path settings:</strong> Make sure <strong>Generate automatic URL alias</strong> is checked.</li>
      <li><strong>Moderation notes:</strong> Note your Jira and the previously translated doc that was merged into this one.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liaison: Based on your conversation with your PM and stakeholders, add the docs to your <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CjFl1_FpzW47KbGVeLynlQ4mZ9KERV4R2OdxWOSYRiY/edit#gid=1415803267">Docs liaison spreadsheet's <strong>Translation Impact</strong> tab</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The translation team then uses the doc's <code>For quote</code> status to prioritize and get budget approval to translate. When translation is completed, the doc's status is updated to <code>Completed</code>.</p>
<h2>Merge an untranslated doc into a translated doc [#merge-untranslated]</h2>
<p>If you merge content from an untranslated doc into a doc that has already been translated, the translation service automatically handles the new content. No additional steps are necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> If you are the Tech Docs liaison for a new feature with multiple existing docs that have already been translated, and if those translated docs will need significant updates, follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Add the translated docs to your <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CjFl1_FpzW47KbGVeLynlQ4mZ9KERV4R2OdxWOSYRiY/edit#gid=1415803267">Docs liaison spreadsheet's <strong>Translation Impact</strong> tab</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Drupal: Edit the doc you want to have re-translated to include the new content, and scroll to the docs <strong>Translation info</strong> section:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Target languages:</strong> <code>Japanese</code></li>
      <li><strong>Translation status:</strong> <code>Completed</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Drupal: Scroll to the bottom of the doc, make the following changes, then save as <strong>Published</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>URL path settings:</strong> Make sure <strong>Generate automatic URL alias</strong> is checked.</li>
      <li><strong>Moderation notes:</strong> Note your Jira and the updated doc's size identified in your Docs liaison spreadsheet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liaison: Add the updated docs' URLs to your <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CjFl1_FpzW47KbGVeLynlQ4mZ9KERV4R2OdxWOSYRiY/edit#gid=1415803267">Docs liaison spreadsheet's <strong>Translation Impact</strong> tab</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The translation team then uses the doc's <code>For quote</code> status to prioritize and get budget approval to translate. When translation is completed, the doc's status is updated to <code>Completed</code>.</p>
<h2>Delete a translated doc [#delete-translated]</h2>
<p>Before you redirect and delete an existing doc:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In your Jira comments: Note the full URL of the translated doc and the full URL of the doc where it has been redirected. Tag Julien Mira in your Jira.</li>
  <li>Liaison: Add the deleted doc's URL to your <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CjFl1_FpzW47KbGVeLynlQ4mZ9KERV4R2OdxWOSYRiY/edit#gid=1415803267">Docs liaison spreadsheet's <strong>Translation Impact</strong> tab</a>.</li>
