<p>The Docs site uses content versioning to track changes within individual docs. When you select a document to edit, Drupal creates a new draft version, and tracks all changes within that draft until it is published. When anyone edits it again, Drupal creates a new version to track the changes since publication.</p>
<p>Each document has two <strong>Moderation</strong> pages to look at revisions: <strong>History</strong> and <strong>Compare revisions</strong>. This is basically the equivalent of "diffing" changes in code branches.</p>

  <p>Some of these features are available only to Drupal admins.</p>

<h2>View history of a doc's changes [#versioning]</h2>
<p>Each document on the Docs site has a <strong>History</strong> page that lists the revisions for that document. It lists the complete history of changes to each node, with the most recent version listed first.</p>
<p>From this page, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View any history version of the document.</li>
  <li>See who made changes when.</li>
  <li>Revert to earlier versions of the document.</li>
  <li>Delete a specific version of a document.</li>
</ul>
<p>To access the document's <strong>History</strong> page:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the document, select the <strong>Moderate</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>From the Workbench, select <strong>List revisions</strong>.</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p><strong>(page) > Moderate:</strong> The Drupal <strong>Revision history</strong> lists each version of a document in reverse chronological order.</p>
<h2>Compare content revisions [#comparing]</h2>
<p>Each document on the site has a <strong>Compare revisions</strong> page that lists the revisions for that document. It lists the complete history of changes to each node, with the most recent version listed first.</p>
<p>From this page, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compare any two versions of the document.</li>
  <li>See who made changes when.</li>
  <li>Revert to earlier versions of the document.</li>
  <li>Delete a specific version of a document.</li>
</ul>
<p>To compare revisions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the document, select the <strong>Moderate > Compare revisions</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>From the Workbench, select <strong>Compare revisions</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select the radio buttons for the two versions you want to compare.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Compare</strong>.</li>
  <li>To scroll through additional revisions, select <strong>Previous difference</strong> or <strong>Next difference</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Drupal displays a table with a color-coded, side-by-side diff report.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>(page) > Moderate > Compare revisions:</strong> Use this page to compare any two versions of a document.</p>
<h2>Schedule content revisions [#scheduling]</h2>
<p>Before you can schedule a publication for individual revisions, you need the revision number. This is the first column in the <a href="#comparing"><strong>Moderation history</strong></a> table. Typically this will be the most recent revision and the first item in the list on the scheduling page.</p>
<p>To schedule a revision:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the <strong>Moderation history</strong> page, select <strong>Schedule</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Add scheduled revision</strong>.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Revision</strong> dropdown, select the version to be scheduled.</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Operation</strong> dropdown, select <strong>Moderate to published</strong>.</li>
  <li>Assign a date and time.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Schedule</strong>.</li>
</ol>

  <p>From here you can also schedule documents to unpublish and auto-delete.</p>
</div>
<h2>Revert content revisions [#reverting]</h2>
<p>If a draft gets published by mistake, you can revert the changes back to any previous version from either of the document moderation pages. To revert to a previous version of the document:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#comparing">Compare revisions</a> to confirm you are looking at the correct versions.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>View</strong> for the version you are <strong>reverting to</strong>, and make sure you are reverting to the correct vesion.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Revert</strong> for the version you are reverting to.</li>
  <li>Publish your changes.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Delete content versions [#deleting]</h2>
<p>You should not need to delete content versions. However, there may be mistakes or abandoned drafts you don't want to accidentally publish.</p>
<p>You only delete active drafts from <strong>Compare revisions</strong>. You cannot delete the currently published revision. Instead, you must <a href="#reverting">revert the currently published version</a> to a previous revision.</p>
<p>To delete a <strong>draft</strong> version of the document:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From <strong>Compare revisions</strong>, make sure the version to be deleted is not the most recently published revision.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Delete</strong> for the draft version you want to delete, and confirm.</li>
</ol>
