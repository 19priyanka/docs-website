<p>If you have sentences that mention single-word system commands, surround these words in code tags so translators don't confuse these words with words in general usage. Here are some words that translators or readers could confuse:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>curl</code>: Sends http requests via a terminal session–not to be confused with the curls you do with weights at the gym.</li>
  <li><code>cat</code>: Lists the first ten lines of a file–not a feline pet who ignores you.</li>
  <li><code>date</code>: Displays the day, year, and time–not an outing that couples take.</li>
  <li><code>tail</code>: Displays the last ten lines of a file–not the appendage on various mammals.</li>
  <li><code>which</code>: Show the location of a program executable–not the pronoun.</li>
</ul>
<p>The moral of the story: If you think a reader or translator might confuse a command with a general English word, just enclose it in &#x3C;code> tags.</p>
