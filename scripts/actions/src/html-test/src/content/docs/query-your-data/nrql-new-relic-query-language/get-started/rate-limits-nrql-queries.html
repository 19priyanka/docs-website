<p>New Relic's query language, NRQL, has rate limits in place to ensure a high level of availability and reliability for all users. To understand the places NRQL can be used, see <a href="/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#where">Where is NRQL used?</a>.</p>
<p>You will rarely encounter rate limiting, especially if you follow these general guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limit the amount of requests with complex queries (for example, queries with <code>FACET</code> or <code>TIMESERIES</code> clauses, or queries of over a million events) that run at the same time.</li>
  <li>Limit the amount of requests run concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of 5, especially if they include complex queries.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limits on queried events [#inspected-count-limits]</h2>
<p>When you run a <a href="/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#what-is-nrql">NRQL query</a>, it will display the number of data types inspected, as shown below:</p>
<p>
  <img src="./images/insights-inspected-event-count-modal_0.png" alt="New Relic inspected event count" title="New Relic inspected event count">
</p>
<p>In this context, "data types" is used in a general sense to refer to all <a href="/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#what-you-can-query">NRQL-available objects</a>; this includes events, metrics, logs, and distributed tracing (span) data.</p>
<p>Each New Relic account has limits on the total number of events that can be inspected. There are limits that apply over two different time frames:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A rolling 30-minute time window</li>
  <li>A 24-hour period</li>
</ul>
<p>These limits are as follows:</p>
<div data-component="Table" data-prop="W10=">
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Time period</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Limit</strong></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Rolling 30 minutes</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>600 billion events inspected (equivalent to a sustained rate of 20 billion events inspected per minute)</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>24 hours</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>7.2 trillion events inspected</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Once the limit has been reached for a given time period, limiting will be imposed and some queries may be impacted. After the time period has passed, if query volume drops below the limit, restrictions will be removed automatically.</p>
<h2>NRQL query rate limits [#query-limits]</h2>
<p>The limit on NRQL queries is 50 queries per second, or 3000 queries per minute. Past this, New Relic cannot guarantee query performance, and you may be rate limited.</p>
<h2>Limits on count of data types [#event-limits]</h2>
<p>The limit for total number of reported data types is 250 per account over a given 24-hour time period. If a user exceeds this limit, New Relic may filter or drop data.</p>
<p>This limit applies to all <a href="/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#what-you-can-query">NRQL-queryable data types</a>. Because there aren't that many different data types reported by New Relic products and integrations, this will mainly be a limit on <a href="/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/send-custom-data-insights">custom events</a>.</p>
