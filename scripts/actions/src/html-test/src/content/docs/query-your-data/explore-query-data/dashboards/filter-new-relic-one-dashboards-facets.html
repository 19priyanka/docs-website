<p>You can filter your <a href="/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards">New Relic One dashboards</a> by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use.</p>
<h2>Why use facet filtering? [#feature]</h2>
<p>In <a href="/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards">New Relic One dashboards</a>, for NRQL queries containing a <a href="/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet"><code>FACET</code> clause</a> and meeting other <a href="#requirements">chart-type requirements</a>, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use.</p>
<p>This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard.</p>

<h2>Example use of facet filtering [#example-use]</h2>
<p>Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a> > Dashboards</strong>: For queries containing a <code>FACET</code> clause and meeting <a href="#requirements">chart-type requirements</a>, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select.</p>
<p>If you select <strong>Filter the current dashboard</strong>, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available <code>userAgentName</code> attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top.</p>
