<p>The Public API Performance dashboard is a dashboard supported by New Relic’s <a href="/docs/query-your-data/new-relic-one-dashboards/global-performance-dataset/new-relic-global-performance-data-sets">Global Performance data sets</a>. It’s an out-of-the-box dashboard included as part of your New Relic account. It provides both actionable general insights about the performance of public APIs and an opportunity for new customers to test-drive New Relic’s dashboarding capabilities before adding their own data.</p>
<p>The dashboard works by showing real latencies experienced by an anonymized sampling of New Relic customers when accessing popular public APIs.</p>

  <p>Global Performance data sets are presented as-is. Global Performance data sets represent an aggregate of samples across a range of sources, and New Relic makes no effort to attempt to confirm the correctness, completeness, or veracity of the data. This data should not be relied on as the sole source of information for any purpose you may use it, and New Relic is not responsible for decisions made in reliance on this data. Global Performance data sets should not be viewed as either an endorsement or a recommendation by New Relic of the technologies represented in the data sets.</p>
