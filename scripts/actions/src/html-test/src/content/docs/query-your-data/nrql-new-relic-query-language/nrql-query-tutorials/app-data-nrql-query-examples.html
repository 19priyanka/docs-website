<pre><code>SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago
</code></pre>
<h2>Unique user trends</h2>
<p>Were your unique user sessions up or down last week compared to the week before?</p>
<pre><code>SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago
</code></pre>
<h2>Pageview trends [#pageview-trend-graphs]</h2>
<p>How can I graph the number of unique users yesterday compared to the day before?</p>
<pre><code>SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago TIMESERIES AUTO
</code></pre>
<h2>OS version [#os-version-example]</h2>

<h2>Key account Apdex [#key-acct-apdex]</h2>
