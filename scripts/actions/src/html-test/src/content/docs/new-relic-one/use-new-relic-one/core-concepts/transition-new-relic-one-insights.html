<p><a href="/docs/insights">New Relic Insights</a> was previously our main way to create custom queries and charts, but now we have <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one">New Relic One</a>, which has its own query builder experience. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience compared to Insights.</p>
<p>This transition guide will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Explain some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features</li>
  <li>Explain why it's easy to switch to New Relic One</li>
  <li>Give you some tips for how to get the most out of using New Relic One</li>
  <li>Explain some details and considerations about making the switch</li>
</ul>
<h2>Improved features in New Relic One [#features]</h2>
<p>New Relic One is an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more.</p>

<p><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a> > Dashboards: New Relic One offers a better querying and charting experience than Insights.</p>
<p>Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better querying and charting experiences, including a <a href="/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-basic-mode-specify-data">"basic" query mode</a> that doesn't require knowledge of <a href="/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql">NRQL</a>.</li>
  <li>Better display options, including easier-to-understand displays for line-heavy, dense charts and a better <a href="/docs/dashboard-tv-mode">TV mode</a>.</li>
  <li>Dashboards with up to 12 charts/widgets across (compared to Insights' 3-across limit).</li>
  <li>Easier creation of <a href="/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/create-dashboards-have-multiple-pages">dashboards with multiple pages</a> (previously called <a href="/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/data-apps-build-collections-linked-dashboards">data apps</a> in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One.</li>
  <li>Improved experience for querying metric data (both the <a href="/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data"><code>Metric</code> data type</a> and <a href="/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-metric-timeslice-data-nrql">metric timeslice data</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Try out New Relic One [#switch]</h2>
<p>It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the <a href="#recommendations">recommendations</a> before you do.</p>
<p>To view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click <strong>Try new dashboards</strong>.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation: <strong>If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards</strong>. This is because, for <a href="#notes-caveats">some types of dashboards</a>, the improved features in New Relic One means a dashboard created there may lose functionality when edited in Insights.</p>
<p>That is the main thing to remember when switching to New Relic One dashboards.</p>
<p>Here are more details and specifics, including details about the above recommendation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Some dashboards, once edited in New Relic One, will lose some functionality when edited in Insights. This applies to these dashboards:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dashboards created using the <a href="/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/explore-data/metric-explorer-search-chart-metrics-sent-new-relic-agents">Insights metric explorer</a>. When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights.</li>
      <li>Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called "data apps." When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the <strong>Data apps</strong> section.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following <strong>Manage data</strong> UI pages will remain in Insights for now:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Summary</strong> UI page</li>
      <li><strong>Add data</strong> UI page</li>
      <li><strong>Embeddables</strong> UI page</li>
      <li><strong>Lookup tables</strong> UI page</li>
      <li><strong>API keys</strong> UI page</li>
      <li><strong>Formatter</strong> UI page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To find these pages: go to <strong><a href="https://insights.newrelic.com">insights.newrelic.com</a> > Manage data</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no dashboard-related APIs. Currently, there are no New Relic One dashboard-related APIs. These APIs are a work-in-progress.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
