<p>New Relic monitoring is built around the concept of the <strong>entity</strong>. This document explains:</p>

  <li>What entities are</li>
  <li>How to find entity data</li>
  <li>How to organize them into groups for easier analysis</li>

<h2>What is an entity? [#what-is-entity]</h2>
<p>From a New Relic product perspective, <strong>entity</strong> is a broad concept. An entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor.</p>
<p>"Entity" can refer to fundamental data-reporting components like applications, hosts, and database services, but it can also refer to larger groupings of those components. For example, to monitor a data center, you could aggregate those hosts in New Relic to be a <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one">workload</a> (a custom grouping of entities). That workload is, itself, also an entity.</p>
<p>This conceptual definition of "entity" is important because New Relic's goal is to give you practical information about the status of your business-important entities (and not just give you an unhelpfully large stream of assorted metrics and data). Our focus on entities, and the relationships between them, helps us optimize monitoring and troubleshooting of complex, modern systems.</p>
<h2>Find and explore entities [#find]</h2>
<p>An entity is anything that reports data to New Relic, so you'll find your entities wherever you see your data reporting in New Relic.</p>
<p>Some tips for finding and understanding entity data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To find an entity's unique global identifier (GUID): from any list of monitored entities in the <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts">entity explorer</a>, hover over a specific entity and click the
    <div data-component="Icon" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJuYW1lIiwidmFsdWUiOiJmZS1pbmZvIn1d"></div>icon to see the GUID and other metadata.
  </li>
  <li>An entity's GUID is reported as the attribute <a href="/attribute-dictionary/span/entityguid"><code>entityGuid</code></a>. You can query for an entity using this attribute in the <a href="/docs/introduction-chart-builder">query builder</a>.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="/docs/service-maps-dependencies-new-relic-one">service maps</a> and <a href="/docs/distributed-tracing-new-relic-one">distributed tracing</a> to see connections between entities.</li>
  <li>Explore entity data using our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer (<a href="https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql">api.newrelic.com/graphiql</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Group and organize entities [#group]</h2>
<p>You can place entities into groups that reflect business-important relationships in your organization. For example, you might group all entities related to a specific team or department, or related to a specific service. Or you might group multiple hosts together to reflect their grouping in a data center.</p>
