<p>For Infinite Tracing, you can supply an optional proxy configuration if outbound traffic needs to flow through a proxy before reaching a trace observer. The language agents that support this are listed below.</p>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJpbXBvcnRhbnQifV0=">
  <p>In order for a proxy to work with Infinite Tracing, it needs to support the HTTP/2 protocol rather than standard HTTP/1.1. Consult your proxy documentation to determine if this support is available.</p>
</div>
<h2>Go</h2>
<p>Specify the proxy address with the environment variables <code>HTTP_PROXY</code>, <code>HTTPS_PROXY</code>, and <code>NO_PROXY</code> (or their corresponding lowercase versions).</p>
<h2>Java</h2>
<p>The Java agent gRPC implementation automatically uses the standard JVM proxy properties as noted in the Java Networking Properties documentation. An example system property configuration may look like this:</p>
<pre><code>-Dhttps.proxyHost=&#x3C;proxy-host> -Dhttps.proxyPort=443
</code></pre>
<p>If your application is already using a proxy, these properties may already be set, in which case gRPC should automatically route Infinite Tracing data through the proxy.</p>
<h2>.NET [#dot-net]</h2>
<p>.Net is not supported.</p>
<h2>Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby [#node-php-python-ruby]</h2>
<p>The proxy address can be specified by the environment variables <code>GRPC_PROXY</code>, <code>HTTPS_PROXY</code> and <code>HTTP_PROXY</code>. These variables are checked in order, and the first one that has a value is used.</p>
