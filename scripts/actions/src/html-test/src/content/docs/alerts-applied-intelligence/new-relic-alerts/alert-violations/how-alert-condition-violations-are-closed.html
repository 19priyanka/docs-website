<p>This document explains the different ways violations can be closed.</p>
<h2>How violations automatically close [#close-automatic]</h2>
<p>A violation will automatically close when the targeted signal returns to a non-violating state for the time period indicated in the condition's thresholds. This wait time is called the <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#recovery-period">recovery period</a>.</p>
<p>For example: If the violating behavior is "Apdex score below 0.80 at least once in 5 minutes," then the violation will automatically close when the Apdex score is equal to or higher than .80 for 5 consecutive minutes. The same applies to a "for at least x minutes" threshold: x minutes of non-violating behavior are required to automatically close the violation.</p>
<p>When a violation closes automatically:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The closing timestamp is backdated to the start of the recovery period.</li>
  <li>The evaluation resets and restarts from when the previous violation ended.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some types of conditions have a <a href="#time-limit">violation time limit</a> setting that will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation.</p>
<h2>Manually close a violation [#close-violation]</h2>
<p>You can manually close an open violation. This is useful, for example, when a signal has violated the threshold, but it no longer exists and also doesn't have a <a href="#time-limit">violation time limit</a>. (A time limit would automatically close a long-lasting violation.)</p>
<p>To close a violation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents#view-violations">open violation</a> you want to close.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Manually close violation</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To close all violations associated with a condition:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions#alert-condition-view">condition</a> you want to close.</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/update-or-disable-policies-conditions#condition-on-off">Disable the condition</a> and then re-enable it.</li>
</ol>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJpbXBvcnRhbnQifV0=">
  <p>An incident will close automatically when all of its associated critical violations have been closed.</p>
</div>
<h2>Set a time limit for long-lasting violations [#time-limit]</h2>
<p>Some types of conditions have a violation time limit setting. This limit will automatically force-close a long-lasting violation after the number of hours you select. This is most useful for ephemeral entities that, when they disappear, cause a continual violation that won't automatically close.</p>
<p><strong>Limits and Defaults</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All alert violations will have a violation time limit applied to them. Most alert conditions will allow you to edit this field.</li>
  <li>The default value, if one is not supplied during configuration, is 30 days.</li>
  <li>Violation time limit can be set as low as 5 minutes, and as high as 30 days. If, for some reason, the signal is still violating in 30 days, the violation will close, and a new violation will open.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You set the violation time limit to 12 hours. If that violation lasts for 12 hours, it will be closed at 12 hours and the condition's evaluation of that entity will be reset.</li>
  <li>Your JVM has a CPU spike and this creates a violation. The JVM then crashes and is replaced by a new JVM. If you have not set a violation time limit, the crashed JVMâ€™s violation will never close.</li>
</ul>
