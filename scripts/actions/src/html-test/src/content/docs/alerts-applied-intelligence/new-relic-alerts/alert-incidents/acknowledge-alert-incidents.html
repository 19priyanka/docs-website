</p>
<p>When you acknowledge an <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/new-relic-alerts-concepts-workflow#terminology">incident</a>, this indicates you're taking ownership of it. This is useful to let others who've received the notification know that you've taken responsibility for it.</p>
<h2>What "acknowledge" means [#ack-role]</h2>
<p>Follow your organization's guidelines for what responsibilities you are agreeing to own when you acknowledge an incident. By acknowledging the incident, this simply flags your name and notifies others.</p>
<div data-component="Callout" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ2YXJpYW50IiwidmFsdWUiOiJ0aXAifV0=">
  <p>To provide a quick reference to your organization's standard operating procedures for handling an alert, you can include a <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/provide-runbook-instructions-alerts">runbook URL in the condition thresholds</a> for the alert policy. The UI will include the runbook URL in <strong>Incidents</strong> pages and in email notifications as applicable.</p>
</div>
<p>Only one person can acknowledge an incident. Once you acknowledge it, you can't undo it. If others try to acknowledge the same incident (for example, from their email notification), the <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-incident-dashboard-details#view-violations">incident's <strong>History</strong> page</a> will appear, showing that the incident has been acknowledged.</p>
<h2>How to acknowledge incidents [#ack-incident]</h2>
<p>The user interface allows you to view incidents and acknowledge them, either from the <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history"><strong>Incidents</strong></a> index or from the selected incident itself. The <strong>Incidents</strong> page provides details about the incident history so you can more easily analyze the chain of events and their timeline throughout an incident.</p>
<p>To acknowledge an incident from the user interface:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com/" title="Link opens in a new window.">one.newrelic.com</a></strong> top nav, click <strong>Alerts &#x26; AI</strong>, click <strong>Incidents</strong>, then click <strong>Open incidents</strong> or <strong>All incidents</strong>.</li>
  <li>From the selected incident row, check whether someone else's name or avatar already appears in the <strong>Acknowledge</strong> column. To find out the user's name, mouse over the avatar.</li>
  <li>To acknowledge the incident, yourself, select the <strong>Acknowledge</strong> icon. 
    <img src="./images/040815-icon-ack.png" alt="040815-icon-ack.png" title="Alerts v3: alert icons">
  </li>
</ol>
<p>This automatically notifies everyone who has been set up to receive the notification. The UI also automatically adds your name (or avatar if applicable) to the incident's <strong>Acknowledge</strong> column.</p>
<h2>What happens to additional violations [#view-more-violations]</h2>
<p>Your <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents">incident rollup preference</a> determines whether and how Alerts will group the additional violations in the <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history"><strong>Incidents</strong> page</a>. If you acknowledge an incident and new <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#alert-violation">violations</a> occur that roll up into the incident you just acknowledged, no further notifications will be sent out until the incident closes.</p>
<h2>Where to view your acknowledged incidents [#view-incident]</h2>
<p>To view any incidents you have acknowledged:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com/" title="Link opens in a new window.">one.newrelic.com</a></strong> top nav, click <strong>Alerts &#x26; AI</strong>, click <strong>Incidents</strong>, then click <strong>Open incidents</strong>.</li>
  <li>Optional: Use any available search or sort options to refine the index results (not available for the <strong>Acknowledge</strong> column).</li>
  <li>Select any row that shows your name or avatar to view the <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history">incident's history and details</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What other options to acknowledge are available [#ack-email-mobile]</h2>
<p>You can use additional methods (channels) to acknowledge notifications. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If your notification channel includes email, you can acknowledge the alert at the time you receive it by selecting the email's <strong>Acknowledge</strong> link.</li>
  <li>If you've registered and linked your iOS or Android mobile app to your account, you can add mobile as a notification channel in your policies. For example, Android users can then acknowledge an alert by using the notification bar. You don't need to open the New Relic app.</li>
</ul>
