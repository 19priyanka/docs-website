<p>With multi-location Synthetic monitoring alert conditions, you can create a monitor to notify you when a specific number of locations are failing at the same time.</p>
<h2>Why this matters [#feature]</h2>
<p>For <a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-synthetics">Synthetic monitoring</a> that runs in multiple <a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#setting-location">locations</a>, a single location will sometimes temporarily fail for a wide variety of reasons. In many cases, a single, short-lived failure does not indicate a problem that would require a notification.</p>
<p>With multi-location conditions, you can set the number of locations that must simultaneous fail in order to trigger a violation and send you a notification. For example, if your monitor is running in six locations, you might set a condition requiring four locations to fail before you receive a notification.</p>

  <p>Multi-location alerts do <strong>not</strong> affect Alerts policies for a Synthetic monitor. For example, <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications">muting a Multi-location alert</a> will <strong>not</strong> mute a <a href="http://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/alerts-synthetic-monitoring#alerts-existing-monitor">Synthetic monitor's alerts.</a></p>

        <p>This feature has a limit of 1000 conditions per account, but some types of Infrastructure alert conditions also count towards this limit. If you get a notification that you've exceeded your limit, contact your account representative or <a href="https://support.newrelic.com/">Support</a> for assistance.</p>

        <p>Status between checks</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>A failed location check will be considered failed until it performs a successful check. For example: a location may fail and then immediately become available, but we'll consider it failed until a scheduled check is reported as successful.</p>

<p>Here's a diagram that shows how a four-location condition will be triggered for non-simultaneous failures:</p>

</p>
<p>This diagram shows an example of how a four-failed-locations setting will trigger a violation for failures that occur one after the other. Note that failed location checks will be viewed as failed until they next have a successful check.</p>
<h2>Create condition from Alerts UI [#create]</h2>
<p>Before creating a condition, read the <a href="#rules">rules for multi-location conditions</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the <strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com/" title="Link opens in a new window.">one.newrelic.com</a></strong> top nav, click <strong>Alerts &#x26; AI</strong>, click <strong>Alert policies</strong>, and start the process to <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions#create-condition">create a condition</a>.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Synthetics</strong>, then click <strong>Multiple location failures</strong>.</li>
</ol>

  <p>You can't view or edit multi-location Synthetic monitoring alert conditions in the <a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/pages/view-monitors-alert-information">Synthetics UI</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2>Create condition with the API [#api]</h2>
<p>Before creating a condition, read the <a href="#rules">rules for multi-location conditions</a>.</p>
<p>To use the Alerts REST API to manage multi-location conditions, use the <a href="https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/alerts_location_failure_conditions/create">REST API explorer</a>.</p>
