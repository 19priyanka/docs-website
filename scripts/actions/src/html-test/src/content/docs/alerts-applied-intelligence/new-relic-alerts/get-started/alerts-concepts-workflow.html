<p>To use alerts well, it will help you to understand the general flow of how the conditions and policies you create lead to violations and notifications.</p>

      <div>
        <p>A policy is a group of one or more alert conditions. You must <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy">create a policy</a> before you can add conditions to it.</p>
        <p>A policy has two settings that apply to all of its conditions: incident preference and notification channels (explained more below).</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Condition</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>A <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/create-alert-conditions">condition</a> includes: a) a monitored data source and b) thresholds that define the behavior that's considered a violation.</p>
        <p>For example, a specific condition might be described in this way: "If the response time for any page load in my app goes above 8 seconds and lasts for more than 5 minutes, that's a violation."</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Threshold</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>A threshold is part of a condition; it defines the behavior that's considered a violation. When you create a condition, there's a required critical-level threshold. Optionally, you can set a secondary warning-level threshold.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Violation</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>A violation occurs when the value of a data source crosses a condition's threshold. This leads to the creation of a <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/violation-event-attributes">violation event</a>, which is used to pass important information downstream.</p>
        <p>A violation doesn't directly generate a notification; a violation may lead to an <strong>incident</strong>, which in turn can generate notifications.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Incident</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Incidents are what generate notifications. At the policy level, the <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents">incident preference</a> determines how violations are handled and combined to generate incidents.</p>
        <p>For example, you may want to have every single violation generate an incident (many notifications) or you may want to have only a single incident open at a time across an entire alert policy (minimal notifications). Setting the incident preference gives you power over how notifications are created and helps prevent notification fatigue.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Notification</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>At the policy level, you choose what team members are notified when an incident occurs and how they're notified. We offer several <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts">notification channels</a>, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, etc. You can include charts about the incident to provide context, and share them with your team's notification.</p>

<h2>Basic workflow [#workflow]</h2>
<p>Now that you understand some basic concepts and terms, let's look at a typical process for creating a policy and an associated condition:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-or-rename-alert-policy">Create a policy</a>. When you create a policy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Give it a meaningful name. For example: the group or team's name, or the set of resources or services the policy targets.</li>
      <li>Set the <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents">incident preference</a>, which determines how violations become incidents.</li>
      <li>Set <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts">notification channels</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-alert-conditions">Create a condition</a> that will be attached to that policy. Steps involved in creating a condition include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a data source that will be monitored (for example, an APM metric or a NRQL query).</li>
      <li><a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/set-thresholds-alert-condition">Set the thresholds</a> that define what behavior will produce a violation.</li>
      <li>Optional: Include a <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/provide-runbook-instructions-alerts">runbook URL</a>, which is used to share standard procedures for how to handle alert notifications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optional: Add more conditions to that same policy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to receiving notifications, you can view the alert <a href="/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#alert-incident">incident</a> or <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-events-their-products">event</a> details in New Relic One.</p>
