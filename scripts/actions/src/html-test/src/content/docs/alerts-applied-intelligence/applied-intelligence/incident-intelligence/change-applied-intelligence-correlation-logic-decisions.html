<p>You can use decisions logic to affect the correlation <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/new-relic-ai/get-started-incident-intelligence">Incident Intelligence</a> provides. Using decisions effectively will give you better issue correlation, which results in reduced noise and increased context.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a> > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions</strong>: This screenshot of our UI shows how each decision correlates your incidents using a specific logic.</p>
<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<p><strong>What is "correlation" and how does it work?</strong></p>
<p>Think of all your incident events from all your alerting engines being sent into Incident Intelligence. The most recently created ones which are open are available for correlation. Correlation occurs between two incidents whenever all the criteria in any Decision is met.</p>
<p><strong>What is issue merging and how does that affect Issue size?</strong></p>
<p>All the incidents available for correlation are tested against each other in all possible pair combinations and a greedy merge is performed. So if A correlates with B into an issue and B correlates with C into another issue, then AB and BC will also merge together resulting in a single Issues with A, B and C inside.</p>
<h2>Review your active decisions [#decisions]</h2>
<p>Decisions determine how Incident Intelligence correlates incidents together. By default, a broad set of decisions is enabled when you start using Incident Intelligence.</p>
<p>To review your decisions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a></strong>, click <strong>Alerts &#x26; AI</strong>, in the left nav under <strong>Incident Intelligence</strong> click <strong>Decisions</strong>.</li>
  <li>Review the list of active decisions.</li>
  <li>To see the rule logic that creates correlations between your issues, click the decision.</li>
  <li>Click the recent correlations tab to see examples of incidents the decision correlated</li>
  <li>Use any of the other options to enable, disable, edit, or delete decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Decisions will routinely be analyzed for their efficacy as well as other best practices, and recommendations will be attached for review.</p>
<h2>Customize your decisions [#customize]</h2>
<p>You can reduce noise with improved correlation by customizing the decisions you use.</p>
<p>You can also create your own decisions in our decision builder:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to <strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a></strong>, click <strong>Alerts &#x26; AI</strong>, in the left nav under <strong>Incident Intelligence</strong> click <strong>Decisions</strong>, then click <strong>Add a decision</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <a href="#decision-guidelines">decision builder guidelines</a> below to build the decision.</p>

        <p>In this step you'll define your filters. Remember correlation occurs between two Incidents. If no filters are defined all Incidents will be used.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, define your filters for the first segment (or bucket) of Incidents, and the second segment of Incidents. Types of filter operators range from substring matching to <a href="#regex">regex matching</a>.</p>
        <p>These will be the two segments of data that will be used in the next step when that data is compared to each other in all possible combinations.</p>

          <li><strong>Time window</strong>: Sets the maximum time between incidents created time for them to be eligible for correlation.</li>
          <li><strong>Issue priority</strong>: Overrides the default priority setting (<code>inherit priority</code>) to add higher or lower priority if the Incidents correlated.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequency</strong>: Modifies the minimum number of incidents that need to meet the rule logic for the decision to trigger.</li>
          <li><strong>Similarity</strong>: If you're using <code>similar to</code> operators in your rule logic, you can choose from a list of algorithms and set their sensitivity. This will apply to all <code>similar to</code> operators in your logic.</li>
        </ul>

<h3>Correlation Statistics [#correlation]</h3>
<p>Whether you want to use the suggested decisions we provide using our pattern recognition algorithms, or you want to add in your own correlation logic, you'll get strong insights into your correlation rate, flapping effectiveness, noise reduction improvement, and the number of correlated issues arising, as shown below.</p>
<p>Remember all statistics are being pulled from NRDB and you are able to view the underlying queries and create your own customized dashboards using this data.</p>
<p><strong>Correlation rate</strong>: The percentage of the time are correlations occurring vs. not.</p>
<p><strong>Total correlated issues</strong>: Number of issues correlated with another issue.</p>
<p><strong>Noise reduction</strong>: Total number of issues after correlation divided by the total number of issues before correlation.</p>
<p><strong>Flapping effectiveness</strong>: The percentage of issues where flapping was detected (opening and closing frequently) and new redundant issues were prevented from opening.</p>
<p><strong>Correlation reason</strong>: Shows which Decisions are correlating issues the most</p>
<h3>Use suggested decisions [#suggested-decisions]</h3>
<p><strong>Suggested Decisions:</strong> The data being sent into Incident Intelligence via Sources is continuously inspected for patterns to help you reduce noise faster. Once patterns have been observed in your data, decisions are suggested that would allow these events to correlate in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerated Suggested Decisions:</strong> As an existing New Relic customer with historical Alerts data, after adding Policies to Sources, Incident Intelligence is able to use that historical data to more accelerate the pattern recognition step and suggest decisions up to 30% faster.</p>
<p>

<p>Decisions Statistic Block</p>
<p>To get started, simply click on one of three suggested decisions right under the statistics block. Once clicked, you'll see information on what the logic is behind the suggested decision and why the trained AI system thinks it will benefit you. In addition, you'll see the estimated correlation rate on that one specific decision.</p>

<p>If there isn't enough data to see the correlation rate, a link right below the percentage estimate will guide you to other sources you can add to get stronger results <em>(note: if you don't have a minimum of 5000 incidents a month, you most likely won't see any suggested decisions).</em></p>
<p>To add the suggested decision, simply click on the activate decision button and it will appear enabled alongside the rest of your decisions. If the decision isn't relevant to your needs, click the dismiss button and you can dismiss it forever or come back to it at a later time.</p>

          <div>
            <p>The fuzzy score algorithm works by allocating "points" for character matches between strings:</p>

              <li>
                <p>Two bonus points for subsequent matches</p>
                <p>The higher the fuzzy score, the greater the similarity between two strings.</p>

            <p>The <strong>fuzzy wuzzy</strong> family of similarity measures was <a href="https://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/fuzzywuzzy-fuzzy-string-matching-in-python/">developed by SeatGeek</a> to help find tickets for the same event that have different labels across multiple platforms. The fuzzy wuzzy ratio for two strings is expressed as a percentage, where a higher number indicates a more similar string. It's based on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html">SequenceMatcher algorithm</a> in Python's difflib.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Fuzzy wuzzy ratio is effective for very short (eg. hostname) or very long (eg. event description) strings, especially in comparing strings of similar length.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio is especially effective for the types of comparisons the basic fuzzy wuzzy algorithm fails at: 3-10 word strings where some significant substrings are likely to be overlapping.</p>

            <p><code>DevOps</code></p>
            <p>…”DevOps” (the shorter string, length = 6) would be compared to each substring with length 6 within “DevOps and SRE teams.” Since one of those substrings (“DevOps”) is a perfect match, the fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio for these two strings will be high.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Where fuzzy wuzzy may be too conservative, fuzzy wuzzy partial match may be more liberal than expected with correlations. You can adjust the threshold in the decision builder according to your needs.</p>

          <div>
            <p>This metric uses a scale of 0-1 to indicate the similarity between two strings, where 0 is no similarity (0 matching characters between strings) and 1 is an exact match. Jaro-Winkler similarity takes into account:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>matching</code>: two characters that are the same and in similar positions in the strings.</li>
              <li><code>transpositions</code>: matching characters that are in different sequence order in the strings.</li>
              <li><code>prefix scale</code>: the Jaro-Winkler distance is adjusted favorably if strings match from the beginning (a prefix is up to 4 characters).</li>

          <div>
            <p>Hamming distance requires the compared strings to be of equal length. This is a useful similarity metric for situations where the difference between two strings may be due to typos, or where you want to compare two attributes with known lengths. For example: Low Disk Space in application myapp in datacenter us01</p>
            <p>If you wanted to be tolerant to datacenter changes, the hamming distance should be set to 4. An average use case for Hamming distance would be around 2-3.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Examples</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>A simpler version of "edit distance" metrics like Levenshtein distance, the Hamming distance between two strings is the number of characters in the string that don't match (in the same position). For example, in the strings below, the Hamming distance is 2:</p>
            <pre><code>flowers / florets

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>In the example above, if the application name changes instead of the datacenter, a correlation would also be created. As the distance grows, the usefulness of Hamming Distance plummets. For this reason, for anything remotely more complicated than being tolerant to 1-2 character substitutions (or if the string lengths will not match), a different similarity measurement should be used.</p>

            <p>The distance, denoted as a percentage (0 being completely similar; 1 being totally dissimilar) is calculated with the following formula:</p>
            <pre><code>1 - [(# of characters in both sets) / (# of characters in either set) * 100]

</code></pre>In other words, the Jaccard distance is the number of shared characters divided by the total number of characters (shared and un-shared). A Jaccard distance of 0.1 means that 10% or fewer characters between two incidents are different.

<h3>Regex operator [#regex]</h3>
<p>Available operators in the <a href="#customize">decision builder</a> include <code>contains (regex)</code> (in step 1 — Tell us what data to compare) and <code>regular expression match</code> (in step 2 — Tell us what to correlate). The decision builder follows the standards outlined in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">these documents for regular expressions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Using regex in step 1 — Tell us what data to compare</strong></p>
<p>In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute value (the data you’re evaluating) must be matched by the regular expression provided. Captured groups can be used but are not explicitly evaluated.</p>
<p>For instance, if the attribute value is <code>foobarbaz</code>, these examples would meet the criteria and test as true:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>foo.*</code></li>
  <li><code>^.*baz</code></li>
  <li><code>\w+</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using regex in step 2 — Tell us what to correlate</strong></p>
<p>In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute values for incident 1 and incident 2 must be included in the match. Also, each captured group (expressions in <code>( )</code> parentheses) must exist in both values (incident 1 and incident 2 attributes), and have the same value:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The number of captured groups must be equal for both incident attributes.</li>
  <li>Each group must be equal to the corresponding group between attribute values: the value of the first captured group in the incident 1 attribute value is equal to the value of the first captured group in the incident 2 attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, if attribute value 1 is <code>abc-123-xyz</code> and attribute value 2 is <code>abc-777-xyz</code>, then <code>(\w+)-(?:\w+)-(\w+)</code> would meet the criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The whole value is matched by the expression.</li>
  <li>The first and third captured groups have the same respective values.</li>
  <li>The second group is not captured using <code>?:</code>, which allows the whole value to match but isn’t used in the capture group comparison.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About flags</strong></p>
<p>No flags are enabled by default. Some useful flags to include in regular expressions in the decision builder are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CASE_INSENSITIVE: (?i)</li>
  <li>MULTILINE: (?m)</li>
  <li>DOTALL: (?s)</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#field.detail">field detail</a> for more notes on the function and implementation of each of these flags.</p>
