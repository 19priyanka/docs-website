<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>You are attempting to install New Relic's Browser agent using the auto-injection or copy/paste method. You see an error message indicating that inline scripts cannot run on the page.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>In order to install the New Relic Browser agent when your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team and request an exception.</li>
  <li>Follow New Relic's procedures to <a href="/docs/csp-v2-host-install-browser-agent">install the Browser agent for CSP</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your organization has a strict process that prohibits CSP exceptions, get support at <a href="https://support.newrelic.com">support.newrelic.com</a> to discuss other options.</p>
<h2>Cause</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/">Content Security Policy v2</a> adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed (such as inline scripts). It also limits <a href="/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-browser#csp">which domains can load scripts</a> during page load.</p>
<p>CSP has multiple levels of complexity. Depending on how it is applied to your pages, it will impact how the Browser agent runs.</p>
