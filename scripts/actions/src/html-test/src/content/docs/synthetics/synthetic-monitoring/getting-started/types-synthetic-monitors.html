<p>You can proactively monitor your website or API endpoints with <a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-synthetics">synthetic</a> monitors. Depending on the type of monitor, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors">Add and edit monitors</a>.</li>
  <li>Use the <a href="/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api">Synthetics REST API</a> to manage monitors.</li>
  <li>Set up monitors from <a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations">specific locations or for private servers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use the <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/create-infrastructure-host-not-reporting-condition">host not reporting</a> feature in <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure">infrastructure monitoring</a>. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts.</p>
<h2>Types of monitors [#types-monitors]</h2>
<p>These are the four types of synthetic monitors:</p>

        <p>Ping monitor</p>
        <p>API name: <code>SIMPLE</code></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site.</p>
        <p>For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as <code>Google Chrome</code>. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Simple browser monitors</p>
        <p>API name: <code>BROWSER</code></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome.</p>
        <p>Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as <code>Google Chrome</code>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Scripted browser monitors</p>
        <p>API name: <code>SCRIPT_BROWSER</code></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present.</p>
        <p>The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of <a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-monitor-runtime-environment#runtime-table">third-party modules</a> to build your custom monitor.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>API tests</p>
        <p>API name: <code>SCRIPT_API</code></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the <a href="https://github.com/request/request" title="Link opens in a new window."><code>http-request</code> module</a> internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.</p>
