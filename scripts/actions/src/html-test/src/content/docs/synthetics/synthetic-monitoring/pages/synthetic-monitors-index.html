<p>In our synthetic monitoring tool, the monitors index lists all monitors associated with your New Relic account, and gives you a quick snapshot of each monitor's performance over the last 24 hours. Select an individual monitor to view a <a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/dashboards/synthetics-overview-dashboard-view-monitors-performance"><strong>Summary</strong> page</a> and get a deeper insight into its performance over time. Or, <a href="#search-monitors">filter the list</a> to quickly compare the performance of similar monitors.</p>

<h2>Understand monitor metrics [#understanding]</h2>
<p>Use the monitors index to access your monitors and view a quick snapshot of monitor performance. The index includes the following metrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/identify-entities-without-alert-policies"><strong>Alert status</strong></a>: Indicates the status of any alerts on the monitor:
    <ul>
      <li>Green: No open violations</li>
      <li>Red: Critical violation in progress</li>
      <li>Grey: No alert conditions defined with New Relic Alerts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Monitor status</strong>: Indicates a status has been applied to the monitor, such as <strong>Mute</strong> or <strong>Disabled</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Success rate</strong>: The percentage of monitor checks that end in success. A multi-step monitor that does not complete all steps is considered a failure.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/adding-editing-monitors#setting-location">Locations failing</a></strong>: The number of locations that have failed during the given timeframe.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/adding-editing-monitors#setting-frequency">Period</a></strong>: How often the monitor checks run.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#setting-type">Monitor type</a></strong>: The selected monitor type.</li>
</ul>
