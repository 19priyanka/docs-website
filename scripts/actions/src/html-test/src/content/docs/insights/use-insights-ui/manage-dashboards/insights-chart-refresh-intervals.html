<p>The refresh rate of UI charts is the range of the query's timeframe divided by 60. The maximum frequency with which queries can be refreshed is every 5 seconds. This applies to <a href="/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights">Insights</a>, <a href="/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards">dashboards in New Relic One</a>, and <a href="/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder">chart builder</a>.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A query with a 7-day time range would have a refresh rate of once every 2.8 hours.</li>
  <li>A query with a 1-hour time range would have a refresh rate of once every 1 minute.</li>
</ul>
<p>For <code>TIMESERIES</code> queries, the widget uses the size of the <code>TIMESERIES</code> bucket as the refresh interval.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 5 minutes</code> would refresh every 5 minutes.</li>
  <li><code>SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 1 hour SINCE 1 day ago</code> would refresh every hour.</li>
</ul>
