<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug where custom events weren't being sent.</p>
    <p>In a refactor of our data collection cycle, we omited the custom events from the list of commands, this is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a very rare bug where the custom event pool could be set to 10 instead of the user config value. This patch was contributed by <a href="https://github.com/shezarkhani">shezarkhani</a>, thanks!</p>
    <p>This case would only be hit if you disabled custom events via server sent config while there were custom events ready to be sent. Then you later reenabled it via server sent config. It would only occur for one data collection cycle then reset back to the correct size.</p>
