<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When the configuration variable <code>startup_connection_retries</code> is set to -1, the Agent will keep checking forever the connectivity at startup to avoid <code>CrashLoopBackOff</code> states in K8S in case of failures. 'startup_connection_retry_time' has been removed and now the Agent uses an exponential backoff algorithm.</li>
  <li>Improve the exponential backoff algorithm the Agent uses when posting metrics fails due to a non 2xx request response.</li>
  <li>Filter duplicated device entries in the <code>StorageSample</code>.</li>
</ul>
