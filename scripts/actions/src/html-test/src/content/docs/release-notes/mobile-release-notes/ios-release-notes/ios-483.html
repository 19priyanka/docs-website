<h3>Notes</h3>
<h4>Improvements</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Crash reporting</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This release introduces <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/ios-agent-crash-reporting">crash reporting for mobile apps</a>. Crash reporting supports capture and reporting of unhandled Objective-C runtime exceptions as well as native crashes like segfaults and bus errors.</li>
      <li>Crashes include <strong>Interaction trails:</strong> a history of automatically instrumented actions that occurred during the app session leading up to the crashing event. No breadcrumbs needed.</li>
      <li>The SDK includes a <code>[NewRelic crashNow]</code> method to trigger a test crash quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>When an app is built for release, the debugging symbols are sent to New Relic (via a dSYM file) to automatically provide human-readable crash reports in the UI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Swift app compatibility</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This release can be safely included in Swift applications. While we do not yet support instrumentation of Swift code, the New Relic SDK is now capable of instrumenting the Objective-C code included in your Swift app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>More configuration options</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>An expanded runtime configuration API now supports disabling of crash reporting and interaction tracing, as well as enabling <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile/getting-started/enabling-swift-interaction-traces">experimental Swift instrumentation</a> for dynamically invoked methods.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
