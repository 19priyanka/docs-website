<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>New Features</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adds Cross Application Transaction Trace linking so that in SOA (service-oriented architectures), all applications that are instrumented by a New Relic agent and that communicate with each other via http will now "link" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. This change helps improve the correlation of performance between services and applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>The installer should now do a better job of cleaning up bad install states. We are uncertain how users get into such a state, but now it is less problematic when it does occur.</li>
</ul>
