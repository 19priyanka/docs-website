<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) “pre-flight” requests with the HTTP OPTIONS method were causing extraneous metrics to be generated for ASP.NET Core applications using the CORS middleware. These requests will now be ignored by the agent.</li>
  <li>Fixes a problem where WCF instrumentation shuts down when WebHttpBinding is used and CAT is enabled.</li>
  <li>Fixes a problem where an async WCF client call may prevent further data from being captured in a transaction.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Adds database instrumentation for Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent">update the .NET agent</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents">upgrade legacy .NET agents</a>.</li>
</ul>
