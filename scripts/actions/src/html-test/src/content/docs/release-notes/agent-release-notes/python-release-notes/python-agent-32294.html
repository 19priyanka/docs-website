<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent contains various bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improved handling of celery max-tasks-per-child</strong></p>
    <p>Data recorded by the Python Agent may not have been reported when celery was operated with the max-tasks-per-child setting. All data is now reported independent of the max tasks per child setting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improve support for PyMongo v3.x</strong></p>
    <p>PyMongo v3 added many new methods on the <code>pymongo.Collection</code> object that did not exist in v2. These methods have now been instrumented. Calls to these methods will now appear in APM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scheduling tasks that run after a transaction ends causes an error</strong></p>
    <p>Coroutines scheduled to execute after a transaction ends using create_task or ensure_future may have caused the runtime instrumentation error and subsequent crash:</p>
    <pre><code>The transaction already completed meaning a child called complete trace after the trace had been finalized.
</code></pre>
    <p>Coroutines that execute beyond the end of a transaction will no longer cause an error.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
