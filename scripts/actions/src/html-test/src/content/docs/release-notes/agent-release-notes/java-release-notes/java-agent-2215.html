<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><em>The 3.x agent works with Java SE 6 and 7. If you are using Java SE 5, this is the release for you.</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PostgreSQL explain plan bug</p>
    <p>There was a PostgreSQL bug that allowed parameters to be sent in explain plans under some circumstances. To avoid this issue, the New Relic agent now does not report explain plans for PostgreSQL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agent no longer supports obfuscation of individual fields</p>
    <p>Previous versions of the agent allowed an obfuscated<em>sql_fields option to select specific field names to obfuscate when record_sql: raw. We have discovered rare cases in which this feature would not mask SQL parameters correctly, so we have removed the configuration option. Now, if obfuscated_sql_fields is set, the setting of record_sql: raw is ignored and _all</em> fields are masked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: SQL parameter obfuscation didn't work if the parameter value contained a newline</p>
    <p>The record_sql: obfuscated config setting did not properly mask parameters when it included a newline character. This bug has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Private trust store location for use_private_ssl flag</p>
    <p>The 2.21.4 agent did not properly load a private trust store used with the use_private_ssl flag. This bug has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
