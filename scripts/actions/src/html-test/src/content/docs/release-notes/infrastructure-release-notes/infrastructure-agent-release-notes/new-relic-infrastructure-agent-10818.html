<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>New Relic Infrastructure agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">Update the Infrastructure agent</a> for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.</p>
<p>Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.</p>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes bug where absolute values specified in custom integration command lines would not be recognized.</li>
  <li>Fixes possible race condition when trying to collect storage metrics that could lead to a panic error and crash the agent.</li>
