<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue where if a customer was using the default proxy and not specifying one in the New Relic configuration for the Agent the default would not be used potentially causing HTTP status code 504 to be thrown when communicating with the New Relic collectors.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where cross application tracing would slow down in environments using WFC with extremely high throughput.</li>
</ul>
