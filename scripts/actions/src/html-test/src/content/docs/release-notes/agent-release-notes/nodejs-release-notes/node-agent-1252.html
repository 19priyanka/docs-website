<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added Q instrumentation.</p>
    <p>The node agent now accurately records programs using Q for promises.</p>
    <p>Thanks to @mdlavin for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added node-mysql2 support.</p>
    <p>Thanks to @jhollingworth for adding node-mysql2 support to the agent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Query streaming in node-mysql now works while using the agent.</p>
    <p>Previously, due to the way node-mysql was instrumented query streaming would be forced off when the agent was collecting data. This is no longer the case and query streaming will work and be recorded as expected.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
