    <p>Distributed tracing</p>
    <p>Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.</p>
    <p>Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing">transition guide</a> before you enable this feature.</p>
    <p>To enable distributed tracing, set the<code>distributed_tracing.enabled</code> configuration option to <code>true</code>.</p>
