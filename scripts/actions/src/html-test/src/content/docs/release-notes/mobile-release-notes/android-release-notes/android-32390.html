<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Call checkcast before invoking NR instrumentation.</p>
    <p>This fixes an issue where the Dalvik VM refuses to load a class with our instrumentation in cases where the inbound object is not the expected type as determined by static code analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don't attempt to instrument constructors in subclasses of classes we normally instrument.</p>
    <p>While we support instrumenting constructors by replacing the call to , we don't support doing this in subclasses. For now, we ignore these cases but may return to adding inline instrumentation to constructors in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Java 7u60 (pre-release) refactored the class in which we were storing our invocation dispatcher.</p>
    <p>We've future proofed the agent by storing the dispatcher in another core class.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
