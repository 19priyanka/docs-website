<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">Update the Infrastructure agent</a> for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.</p>
<p>Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Test if the configured license is obviously not correct.</li>
  <li>Check network availability at startup to ascertain agent can communicate with New Relic.</li>
  <li>Additional verbose logging for debugging network data.</li>
  <li>Added an <code>event_queue_depth</code> config option (default 1000) to support hosts with high numbers of processes (100s or more). Adjust this number in increments of 1000 if you see "Queue full" messages in the logs. Will require a restart of the agent to take effect.</li>
</ul>
