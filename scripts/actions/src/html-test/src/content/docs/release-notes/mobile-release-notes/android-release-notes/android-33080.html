<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New API methods for adding cross application tracing headers to noticeHttpTransaction().</p>
    <p>In case the New Relic agent doesn't support the HTTP API you're using, you can manually submit a transaction via the noticeHttpTransaction() method. With this release, this method now allows you to set the NR cross application tracing header for tracking purposes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a rare build crash where newly constructed objects go unused and are later optimized down by ProGuard.</li>
</ul>
