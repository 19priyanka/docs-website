<h2>Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed bug where agent would count errors towards error metrics even if they were dropped due to the error collector being disabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agent will now properly track cached paths to files in loaded modules on Node versions >10.</p>
    <p>As of Node v11, the path to a file in a module being loaded will only be resolved on the first load; subsequent resolution of that file will use a cached value. The agent records this resolved path and uses it for relative file look ups in order to deep link into modules using <code>Shim#require</code>. Since the agent couldn't reliably get at the path on the subsequent calls to require, it now replicates the caching logic and hold onto the resolved path for a given file.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
