<h3>New Features</h3>
<p>This is the first release of the New Relic C SDK! If your application does not use <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-agents-products#apm-compatibility">other New Relic APM agent languages</a>, you can use the C SDK to take advantage of New Relic's monitoring capabilities and features to instrument a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>For more information, see:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/c-sdk">Documentation</a>: How to get started with the C SDK, install and configure it, instrument transactions, segments, and errors, use the C SDK API, and do some basic troubleshooting.</li>
  <li><a href="https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/index.html">GitHub</a>: SDK files, data structure, field definitions and parameters, code examples, functions, variables.</li>
</ul>
<h3>End of Life Notice</h3>
<p>The previous APM Agent SDK is deprecated beta software. If you were previously using the Agent SDK, you can switch to the C SDK. Check the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/c-sdk-compatibility-requirements">compatibility and requirements</a>, and then <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/install-c-sdk-compile-link-your-code">instrument, compile and link</a> your application's code to use the C SDK. The C SDK currently does not support New Relic's HSM feature; this may impact how you schedule your transition away from the Agent SDK.</p>
