<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent includes changes to the agent to enable monitoring of Lambda functions, improves the built-in Sanic instrumentation, and includes various bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Monitoring of Lambda functions</strong></p>
    <p>This release includes changes to the agent to enable monitoring of Lambda functions. If you are interested in learning more or previewing New Relic Lambda monitoring please email <a href="mailto:lambda_preview@newrelic.com">lambda_preview@newrelic.com</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improve naming of Sanic HTTPMethodView view handlers</strong></p>
    <p>Sanic views that were defined using the HTTPMethodView class were previously all named <code>HTTPMethodView.as_view.&#x3C;locals>.view</code> regardless of the actual class in use. The agent will now name transactions after the actual view handler class.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix ignored error reporting in CherryPy instrumention</strong></p>
    <p>When missing query parameters, unexpected query parameters, unexpected positional arguments, or duplicate arguments were present in the CherryPy framework, a TypeError exception was recorded even when an ignored response status code (such as a 404) was generated. An error is no longer recorded when it results in the generation of an ignored status code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Excluding <code>request.uri</code> from transaction trace attributes hides it in the UI</strong></p>
    <p>When <code>request.uri</code> is added to either <code>attributes.exclude</code> or <code>transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude</code>, the value will now no longer be sent to New Relic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ability to disable sending <code>request.uri</code> as part of error traces</strong></p>
    <p>When <code>request.uri</code> is added to either <code>attributes.exclude</code> or <code>error_collector.attributes.exclude</code>, the value will now no longer be sent to New Relic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix tracing of functions returning generators</strong></p>
    <p>When tracing generators whose parent traces have ended an error was seen in the logs "Transaction ended but current_node is not Sentinel." This has now been fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
