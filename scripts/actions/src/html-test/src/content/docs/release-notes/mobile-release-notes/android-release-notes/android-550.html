<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>This release adds a new feature flag, <em>DefaultInteractions</em>, that controls whether automatically instrumented (default) interactions are collected by the agent. With auto-instrumented interactions disabled, only custom interactions (interactions created through the public New Relic agent API) will be recorded. This flag is <em><strong>enabled</strong></em> by default, and is disabled by calling</p>
<p><code>NewRelic.disableFeature(FeatureFlag.DefaultInteractions);</code></p>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes a problem reading a response body in asynchronous network requests via OkHttp, which was introduced by version 5.4.1.</li>
</ul>
