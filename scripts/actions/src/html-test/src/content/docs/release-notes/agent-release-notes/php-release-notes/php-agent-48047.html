<h3>Notes</h3>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Upgraded to cURL version 7.35 from 7.30.</li>
  <li>Upgraded to OpenSSL 1.0.1g from 1.0.1e.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed an issue that would cause New Relic cross application tracing headers to accumulate during multiple <code>curl_exec()</code> calls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed an issue with the installer when the path includes spaces. When <code>newrelic-install.sh</code> was run from a path that included spaces, such as <code>/tmp/new relic/newrelic-php5-4.6.5.40-linux</code>, the installation would fail. This has been corrected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed an issue where not all Drupal 8 hooks were instrumented.</p>
    <p>While most Drupal 8 hooks are executed via <code>ModuleHandlerInterface::invoke()</code> and <code>ModuleHandlerInterface::invokeAll()</code>, a handful such as <code>page_build</code> are executed via variable functions by Drupal 8 as they require their arguments to be passed by reference. These hooks are now instrumented correctly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
