<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent adds improvements to django instrumentation, improvements to django rest framework instrumentation, and various bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Improved Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enabled reporting of handled exceptions in Django REST Framework</strong></p>
    <p>Exceptions handled by django rest framework are now reported if the resulting response code is not ignored (see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#error-ignore-status-codes">ignore_status_codes</a> for details).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add support for the error_collector.ignore_status_codes setting in Django</strong></p>
    <p>Ignoring exceptions in Django was previously limited to the error_collector.ignore_errors configuration option. Ignoring exceptions by response status code is now supported for Django through the use of the error_collector.ignore_status_codes configuration option.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Servicing aiohttp websocket requests results in an application crash</strong></p>
    <p>Servicing a websocket request in an aiohttp application may have resulted in an application crash when using the New Relic python agent. The application will now operate as expected when handling a websocket request.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ignore incomplete aiohttp transactions</strong></p>
    <p>In aiohttp, connections can be terminated prior to the HTTP response being generated and sent. In those cases, the request handler may be cancelled. These transactions are no longer reported.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix HTTP status reporting for Tornado transactions</strong></p>
    <p>HTTP status was not properly added to Tornado transaction events and transaction traces. HTTP status is now automatically added to Tornado transaction events in Insights and transaction traces in APM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix reporting of concurrent external requests in Tornado</strong></p>
    <p>External requests that execute in parallel in a tornado application may not have been recorded. This issue has been addressed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
