<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader()</code> API now includes the full transaction name.</p>
    <p>Previously, the agent would use a fragment of the transaction name, causing Browser Monitoring transactions and APM transactions to not be cross linked. This change makes the cross linking work correctly.</p>
