<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Naming changes to Interaction Traces</p>
    <p>We've changed the naming scheme for Interaction Traces to be more clear. Instead of "ActivityClass#onCreate", you'll see "Display ActivityClass". If you want to change the name of a running Interaction, just call <code>setInteractionName()</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New API methods for starting and stopping Interaction Traces</p>
    <p>We've added two new methods to the NewRelic class API to give you greater control over starting and stopping Interaction Traces. The <code>startInteraction()</code> method now just takes a string, no context needed. Use <code>endInteraction()</code> to stop a running interaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New <code>@SkipTrace</code> annotation to exclude methods from default instrumentation</p>
    <p>While automatic instrumentation is one of the more convenient features of the agent, there are a few cases where it can get in the way. Should you encounter one of these cases, simply add this annotation to the method in question, and the agent will skip it during compile time instrumentation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
