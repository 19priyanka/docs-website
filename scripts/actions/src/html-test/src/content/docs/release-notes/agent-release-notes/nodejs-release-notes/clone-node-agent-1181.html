<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Names assigned to errors via <code>Error.name</code> now appear in the UI.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Previously, the name of an error in the UI appeared as <code>Error.constructor.name</code> or with a default of <code>Error</code>. Now the common pattern of <code>Error.name</code> is respected and takes precedence.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Child segments of external calls will now be nested correctly.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This change causes segments that make up external calls to nest under the call correctly. Previously, the child segments appeared as siblings to external calls.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>request_uri</code> attribute on errors will now only include the path without any parameters.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This behavior now matches the other New Relic agents.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
