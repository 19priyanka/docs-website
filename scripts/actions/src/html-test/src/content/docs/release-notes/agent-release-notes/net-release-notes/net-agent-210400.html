<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug whereby IIS applications with underscore characters in their names were not displayed correctly in the Status Monitor.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug whereby users could not view the log file for some IIS applications in the Status Monitor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvements</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved the naming of MVC transactions. Naming to controller/action should be much more reliable now.</li>
  <li>Improved WebAPI support. You should now see Web Transactions grouped by [controller].[action] rather than all WebAPI transactions reporting as System.Web.Http.WebHost.HttpControllerHandler.</li>
</ul>
