<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS Agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.</p>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Release ID API:</strong> A new API allows you to uniquely identify your current JavaScript version, enabling a richer error feature with source maps identification. Stay tuned for more information and documentation!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Passive Scroll Event Listeners:</strong> Previously, the wrapped scroll event listener did not take advantage of an available performance optimization: the passive annotation. By including this annotation, our wrapped scroll listener will allow a non-blocking, smooth scrolling action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>XHR With Credentials:</strong> Previously, when the agent would send data using an XHR, it would feature-check the <code>withCredentials</code> property and set it to <code>true</code> if it was available. However, older versions of IE do not allow modification of the <code>withCredentials</code> property on unsent XHRs. The agent now wraps the property assignment in a try/catch block to prevent errors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
