    <p><strong>Bugfix: obfuscating URLs to external services no longer modifying original URI</strong></p>
    <p>A recent change to the Ruby agent to obfuscate URIs sent to external services had the unintended side-effect of removing query parameters from the original URI. This is fixed to obfuscate while also preserving the original URI.</p>
    <p>Thanks to @VictorJimenezKwast for pinpointing and helpful unit test to demonstrate.</p>
