<h3>Distributed tracing for cross-origin AJAX calls</h3>
<p>The agent can now add the <code>newrelic</code> distributed tracing header to outgoing cross-origin AJAX calls. The origins that the agent should add headers to must be defined in the <code>distributed_tracing.allowed_origins</code> configuration section. Users can now enable CORS from the Browser 'Application settings' page.
