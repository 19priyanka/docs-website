<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This release adds a new API method <code>withApplicationBuild(String build)</code> which replaces the now deprecated method, <code>withBuildIdentifier(String build)</code>. The functionality remains the same, allowing the application build to be set rather than relying on the <code>versionCode</code>. See <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-sdk-api/new-relic-mobile-sdk-api/work-android-sdk-api">Android API documentation</a> for details.</li>
  <li>Log messages from the Android SDK have been updated to reflect updated New Relic support team contact information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This release improves UI performance when an app has crashed and that crash is being sent to New Relic.</li>
  <li>The logic for sampling memory and CPU resources during an interaction trace was improved to limit the use of system resources.</li>
  <li>A crash was addressed in a rare instance when the Apache <code>BasicHttpRequest</code> library was used for networking purposes.</li>
</ul>
