<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: In some cases, Play 2.2 didn't report transactions</p>
    <p>When a chain of promises resolved, specifically using Future.flatMap(), lingering promises prevented the transaction from completing, in which case the transaction wouldn't be reported for the app. This is now tracked correctly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Improved performance when instrumented code is not running in a transaction</p>
    <p>Avoids unnecessary work when code instrumented by the Java agent is not running in the scope of a transaction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
