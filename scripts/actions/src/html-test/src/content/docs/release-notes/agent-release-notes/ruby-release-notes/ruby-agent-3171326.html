<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Datastore instance reporting for Redis, MongoDB, and memcached</p>
    <p>The agent now collects datastore instance information for Redis, MongoDB, and memcached. This information is displayed in transaction traces and slow query traces. For memcached only, multi requests will expand to individual server nodes, and the operation and key(s) will show in the trace details "Database query" section. Metrics for <code>get_multi</code> nodes will change slightly. Parent nodes for a <code>get_multi</code> will be recorded as generic segments. Their children will be recorded as datastore segments under the name <code>get_multi_request</code> and represent a batch request to a single Memcached instance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rescue errors from attempts to fetch slow query explain plans</p>
    <p>For slow queries through ActiveRecord 4+, the agent will attempt to fetch an explain plan on SELECT statements. In the event that this causes an error, such as being run on an adapter that doesn't implement <code>exec_query</code>, the agent will now rescue and log those errors. n</p>
  </li>
