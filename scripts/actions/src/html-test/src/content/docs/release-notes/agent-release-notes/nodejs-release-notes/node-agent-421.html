<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added more tests for transaction naming with Restify.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed issue with tracking external requests to default ports.</p>
    <p>Special thanks to Ryan King for pinpointing the cause of this issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added extra check for handling arrays of functions when wrapping middleware mounters.</p>
    <p>This fixes a bug with the agent incorrectly assuming that arrays passed as the first argument in middleware would only contain route paths, causing a fatal error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agent now reports the total time of the transaction on transaction events.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
