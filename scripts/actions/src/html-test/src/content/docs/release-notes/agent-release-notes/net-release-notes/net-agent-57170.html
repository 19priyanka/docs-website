<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused certain frameworks (such as EpiServer CMS) to throw exceptions when trying to resolve a reference to JetBrains.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused ASMX web service exceptions to not be noticed. This would result in missing some error details, such as stack traces.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where sometimes transactions will not be reported if the <code>HttpClient</code> class is used during that transaction.</li>
</ul>
