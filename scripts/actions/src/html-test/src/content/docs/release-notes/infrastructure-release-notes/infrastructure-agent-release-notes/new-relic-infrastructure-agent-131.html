<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added HTTPS proxy certificate verification. You can enable it with the <code>proxy_validate_certificates: true</code> configuration option. When this option is set to <code>true</code> and you setup an HTTPS proxy with self-signed certificates, you may need to specify the certificates location with the <code>ca_bundle_file</code>or <code>ca_bundle_dir</code> configuration options.</li>
  <li>Added a Proxy Configuration Plugin that submits non-sensitive proxy configuration information as inventory. To disable it, set the <code>proxy_config_plugin: false</code> configuration option.</li>
  <li>Warn on RPM plugin package parsing error.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Increased the intervals of some samplers
    <ul>
      <li>Increased ProcessSample default interval from 10 to 20</li>
      <li>Increased StorageSample default interval from 5 to 20</li>
      <li>Increased NetworkSample default interval from 5 to 10</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When the configuration option <code>startup_connection_retries</code> is set to -1, the Agent, at startup, will keep checking forever the connectivity.</li>
  <li>The configuration option <code>startup_connection_retry_time</code> has been removed and now the Agent uses an exponential backoff algorithm.</li>
  <li>The Windows Agent does not ignore <code>A:</code> and <code>B:</code> drives anymore, as they may be mapped to actual Hard Disks. If those drives are reported because they map into a removable drive and you don't want the agent to report them, you can set the <code>win_removable_drives: false</code> configuration option.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug that may cause some configuration options to be ignored when settting via environment variables (e.g. <code>NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE</code> or <code>NRIA_PROXY_VALIDATE_CERTIFICATES</code>)</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the Linux agent that prevented the agent from loading the system root certificates when the <code>ca_bundle_dir</code> or <code>ca_bundle_file</code> options were specified. This bug can't be fixed in the Windows Agent so the user will need to place in the <code>ca_bundle_dir</code> a copy of the New Relic certificate.</li>
</ul>
