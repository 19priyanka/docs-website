<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>New Relic Infrastructure agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">Update the Infrastructure agent</a> for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.</p>
<p>Note also that this is a Linux and Windows release.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Factor built-in integration filters noisy <code>puppet_agent_pid</code> change events.</li>
  <li>Enhanced information available when running in verbose logging mode to help find StorageSample issues with unsupported file systems.</li>
  <li>StorageSamples are now collected for <code>vxfs</code> filesystem on Linux.</li>
  <li>Windows: <code>svchost.exe</code> processes will show more context info in their process names (akin to TaskMgr.exe behavior).</li>
  <li>Windows: Initial support for optional <code>enabled_elevated_process_priv</code> (set to <code>true</code> to use) which captures more process information if the account being used to run the agent has the <code>SeDebugPrivilege</code> right in its local policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>StorageSample I/O calculations that show percentage should now display a ceiling of 100%.</li>
  <li>Agent will better detect when a PID is reused on Linux and Windows, and refresh any cached information about that process.</li>
  <li>Windows: built-in integration <code>lp.exe</code> (List Packages), has been re-written to use the latest On Host Integration SDK and protocol. The original integration was not working reliably and could litter logs with warnings.</li>
</ul>
