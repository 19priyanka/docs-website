<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Flexible capturing of attributes</p>
    <p>The Java agent offers the ability to fine tune the attributes being sent to New Relic. Please see our docs site for more information on configuring attributes: <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/java-agent-attributes">https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/java-agent-attributes</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agent-Side High Security Configuration</p>
    <p>If your account is set to high security in the New Relic UI, you must add the following to your local newrelic.yml configuration file:</p>
    <pre><code>high_security: true
</code></pre>
    <p>Without this property, the agent will stop collecting data when high security is enabled in the New Relic UI. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/subscriptions/high-security">https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/subscriptions/high-security</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discovery of hostname reported to New Relic</p>
    <p>If New Relic reports an IP address for your hostname, you can now control whether the host name is an IP version 4 or 6 address by setting the following property in your newrelic.yml configuration file:</p>
    <pre><code>process_host: 
  ipv_preference: {4 or 6}
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved JMX metric naming</p>
    <p>You can now set the metric name when configuring JMX metrics through a custom yaml file using the property "root_metric_name". Note, all of the JMX metrics will still be prefixed with "JMX" and end with the name of the attribute. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/custom-jmx-yaml-examples">https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/custom-jmx-yaml-examples</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Naming of CGLib classes</p>
    <p>CGLib auto generated classes with Spring resulted in poor metric names. The agent now excludes the random part from the name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: JMS transaction naming</p>
    <p>JMS onMessage instrumentation now uses a lower priority for naming transactions and honors the enable_auto_transaction_naming config.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved Jetty coverage</p>
    <p>Jetty versions 9.04 through 9.06 were not instrumented. This has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Potential memory leak from database calls</p>
    <p>In some cases when database work is performed outside of a New Relic transaction, a memory leak could occur. This bug has been present in the agent since 3.5.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: VerifyError can occur when using Nevado JMS.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
