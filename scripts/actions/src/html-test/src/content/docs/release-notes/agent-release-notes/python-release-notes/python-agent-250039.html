<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This release of the Python agent adds support for Django 1.8.</p>

<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Django 1.8.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features Changed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The list of modules loaded by the application will no longer include version numbers. In certain cases, attempting to determine the version numbers of packages can potentially generate excessive CPU overhead, so it has been preemptively disabled to prevent any such occurrence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When using the psycopg2 Postgres database adapter, if the <code>pscyopg2.extras.register_json()</code> function was used, then instrumentation for the psycopg2 module would fail. Now, <code>register_json()</code> is instrumented correctly.</li>
  <li>If a Django class based view was registered as the view handler in <strong>urls.py</strong>, the transaction was named after the class name, and not the method of the class based view which handled the request. Now, the transaction is named after the method.</li>
</ul>
