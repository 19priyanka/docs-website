<h3>Bug fixes/Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The value of headers inserted into the HTTP response returned from the WSGI application to support cross process application tracing were being incorrectly passed as Unicode strings on Python 2. This would cause a strictly compliant WSGI server such as Apache/mod_wsgi or uWSGI to raise an error when the headers were being set. In general, pure Python WSGI servers are not as strict in their WSGI compliance and would have silently accepted the value anyway, converting it to a byte string using the Python system default encoding.</li>
</ul>
