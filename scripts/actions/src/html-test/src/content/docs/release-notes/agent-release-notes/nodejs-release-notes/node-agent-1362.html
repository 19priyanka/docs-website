<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed issue with timing Redis operations when called without a callback.</p>
    <p>Previously these operations would continue to be timed until the transaction ended, and as a result reported incorrect times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transactions that result in a 404 HTTP error are now named "(not found)".</p>
    <p>Previously these transactions were reported with no name (e.g. get /).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the newrelic.js configuration file is not present, the agent now logs a message to the console and no longer prevents the app from starting up.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
