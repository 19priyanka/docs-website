<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic-koa">@newrelic/koa</a> as a dependency.</p>
    <p>This introduces instrumentation for Koa v2.0.0 or higher. It will be treated as first-party instrumentation within the agent, but publishing it as a separate module allows it to be installed independently according to users' needs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Refactored instrumentation hooks to work with modules.</p>
    <p>With this change it is now possible to link against external instrumentation modules.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
