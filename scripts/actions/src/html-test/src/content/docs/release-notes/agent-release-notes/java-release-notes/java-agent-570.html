<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Java 13</p>
    <p>The New Relic Java agent is now fully compatible with version 13 of the OpenJDK and Hotspot JDKs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Calls to NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addOutboundRequestHeaders() will no longer throw an exception if a traced method has started but a transaction has not. This could happen by calling this in a method annotated with <code>@Trace(async=true)</code> before a token is linked.</li>
  <li>Updates Guava to the newest release.</li>
  <li>NoClassDefFoundError would occur in agent logs when a spring controller is used without a root level RequestMapping annotation.</li>
  <li>The gc_time metric, which was enabled by default in version 5.2.0, has now been disabled by default since its results are often misleading.</li>
</ul>
