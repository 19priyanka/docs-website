<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added StackExchange.Redis framework support. The .Net agent now records time spent making StackExchange.Redis API calls, which will appear as Datastore metrics and Transaction Trace segments in New Relic APM.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug that cause Automatic Browser Monitoring to cause problems on web pages that have no HEAD tag and also contain the text "&#x3C;BODY" inside of an inline script.</li>
  <li>Improved agent error reporting for applications using WebAPI v1 in unsupported configurations. A warning will be displayed in the agent log (during agent startup) if an application is using an unsupported configuration.</li>
  <li>Azure KUDU (scm) sites were being instrumented by the .NET Agent due to a change in the way Azure is naming application pools. We have updated our logic to match the new application pool naming so these sites will be ignored by the agent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
