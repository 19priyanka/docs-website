<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed issue where transactions may not get reported when custom instrumentation is applied to async methods with a void return type. Instrumenting async void methods is generally not recommended and may result in unexpected segment timing as well as the disruption of downstream instrumentation. Please review async limitations online help for alternative approaches.</li>
</ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
