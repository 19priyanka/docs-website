<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Send synthetics headers even when CAT disabled</p>
    <p>The agent now sends synthetics headers whenever they are received from an external request, even if cross-application tracing is disabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for DelayedJob Daemonization</p>
    <p>Customers using the delayed_job script that ships with the gem may encounter an IOError with a message indicating the stream was closed. This was due to the agent attempting to write a byte into a Pipe that was closed during the deamonization of the delayed_job script. This issue has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collect supportability metrics for public API</p>
    <p>The agent now collects Supportability/API/{method} metrics to track usage of all methods in the agent's public API.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collect supportability metrics on <code>Module#prepend</code></p>
    <p>The agent now collects Supportability/PrependedModules/{Module} metrics for ActiveRecord 4 and 5, ActionController 4 and 5, ActionView 4 and 5, ActiveJob 5, and ActionCable 5. These help track the adoption of the <code>Module#prepend</code> method so we can maintain compatibility with newer versions of Ruby and Rails.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collect explain plans when using PostGIS ActiveRecord adapter</p>
    <p>The agent will now collect slow SQL explain plans, if configured to, on connections using the PostGIS adapter. Thanks Ari Pollak for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lazily Intialize New Relic Config</p>
    <p>The agent will lazily initialize the New Relic config. This allows the agent to pickup configuration from environment variables set by dotenv and similar tools.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
