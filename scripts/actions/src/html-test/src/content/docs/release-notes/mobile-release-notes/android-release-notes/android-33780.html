<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CPU vitals in Interaction traces.</p>
    <p>We've added CPU vitals in interaction traces. You'll now be able to see your application's usage of the device's CPU(s) as a percentage of the total CPU time.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Restore compatibility for building with Java 7u55 and support Java 8.</p>
    <p>Java 7u55 introduced a slight change that broke our build process. We've corrected this issue and added support for Java 8.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Applications without version numbers crashed the agent.</p>
    <p>Strangely, it's possible to build an Android application without a version number defined in the manifest. We now detect this case and shut down the agent cleanly with an error message indicating we require a version number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encode custom Http(s) error response bodies.</p>
    <p>Http(s) error response bodies are normally encoded to ease escaping. However, errors reported via the API were not encoded. We've fixed this so all errors should appear properly in the UI.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
