<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Spring Web Services
    <ul>
      <li>The Java Agent now supports Spring Web Services. Transactions are named based on the SOAP method name. The agent also reports the SOAP version, content type, and SOAP Action.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Support for Auto-RUM and precompiled JSPs
    <ul>
      <li>The Java agent now provides auto rum support when precompiling JSPs. To use auto rum when precompiling JSP files, add the agent as a java agent to your pre-compilation process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix: Under some circumstances the agent would report a LinkageError</li>
  <li>Fix: Grails 2 transaction names had extra slash</li>
  <li>Fix for auto-RUM
    <ul>
      <li>In some cases when a script tag is before a head tag in a JSP file, the auto RUM instrumentation was failing to place the initial New Relic header script in the page.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fix: Reduce overhead of Akka instrumentation when not used in conjunction with Play/Netty</li>
  <li>Fix: RabbitMQ instrumentation reported unnecessary transactions

</ul>
