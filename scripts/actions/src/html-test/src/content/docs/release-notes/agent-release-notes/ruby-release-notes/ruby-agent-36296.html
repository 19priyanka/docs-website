<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sequel support</p>
    <p>The Ruby agent now supports Sequel, a database toolkit for Ruby. This includes capturing SQL calls and model operations in transaction traces, and recording slow SQL calls. See <a href="https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/sequel-instrumentation">https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/sequel-instrumentation</a> for full details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thread profiling fix</p>
    <p>The prior release of the agent (version 3.6.1) broke thread profiling. A profile would appear to run, but return no data. This has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix for over-counted Net::HTTP calls</p>
    <p>Under some circumstances, calls into Net::HTTP were being counted twice in metrics and transaction traces. This has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Missing traced errors for Resque applications</p>
    <p>Traced errors weren't displaying for some Resque workers, although the errors were factored into the overall count graphs. This has been fixed, and traced errors should be available again after upgrading the agent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
