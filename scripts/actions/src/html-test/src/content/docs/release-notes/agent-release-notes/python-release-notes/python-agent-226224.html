<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to prevent proxy credentials set in the agent configuration file from being transmitted to New Relic.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from our <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Previously, the agent stripped the <code>proxy_user</code> and <code>proxy_pass</code> settings when it transmitted configuration settings to New Relic, so as not to expose credentials. However, the <code>proxy_host</code> setting was transmitted unaltered, even if it was a URI containing a username and/or password. With this release, proxy usernames and passwords specified in a URI in the <code>proxy_host</code> setting are obfuscated before being transmitted. In addition, the <code>proxy_user</code> and <code>proxy_pass</code> settings are obfuscated, and are also transmitted.</li>
</ul>
