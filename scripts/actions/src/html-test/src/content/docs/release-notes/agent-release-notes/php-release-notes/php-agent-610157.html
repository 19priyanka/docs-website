<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Support has been added for Magento 2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Laravel 5.2 has been added. Previously, Laravel 5.2 applications would fail to start with a <code>BadMethodCallException</code>. This was due to the agent's attempted use of a route filter for automatic transaction naming. Automatic transaction naming for Laravel 5.2 no longer relies on a route filter preventing the error. Automatic transaction naming for older versions of Laravel is unaffected.</li>
  <li>Calling <code>phpversion("newrelic")</code> could return <code>"unreleased"</code> instead of the actual version number. In turn, this caused <code>composer show --platform</code> to report a version of 0. This has been fixed. The version number reported by <code>phpinfo()</code> was not affected by this bug.</li>
  <li>Fixed a potential segfault when using <code>Zend_Http_Client</code> under PHP 5.5 or 5.6 with OPcache enabled.</li>
</ul>
