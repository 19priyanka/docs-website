<h3>New Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Instrumentation added for the Cornice REST component library for the Pyramid web framework.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes/Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Enhance the instrumentation for the Bottle web framework to work around the problem that the Bottle framework was not using 'functools.wraps()' correctly in the implementation of its 'auth_basic()' decorator. This was resulting in the web transaction being named after the 'wrapper' function closure used in the implementation of the decorator rather than the wrapped request handler the decorator was applied to. A pull request was made against the Bottle framework and the change will be included in a future version of Bottle. Our change ensures that the correct result is also obtained with older Bottle versions.</li>
  <li>When using the database connection object created by the sqlite3 database client module as a context manager, the automatic rollback or commit performed by the context manager when the scope of the context manager is exited, will now be tracked.</li>
  <li>If a function trace was applied to the bound method of a class implemented in a C extension module, the name of the module shown in the name of the function was being wrongly designated as the Python 'builtins' module.</li>
  <li>Updated memcache instrumentation wrappers to use our latest function wrapper implementation. Our latest function wrappers better preserve the ability to introspect wrapped functions/methods and so return the same result as one would expect if no wrapper had been applied.</li>
</ul>
