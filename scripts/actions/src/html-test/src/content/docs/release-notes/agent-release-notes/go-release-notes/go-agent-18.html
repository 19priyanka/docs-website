<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed incorrect metric rule application when the metric rule is flagged to terminate and matches but the name is unchanged.</li>
  <li><code>Segment.End()</code>, <code>DatastoreSegment.End()</code>, and <code>ExternalSegment.End()</code> methods now return an error which may be helpful in diagnosing situations where segment data is unexpectedly missing.</li>
</ul>
