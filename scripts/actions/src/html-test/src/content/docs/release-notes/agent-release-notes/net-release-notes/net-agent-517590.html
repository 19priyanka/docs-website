<h3>New Features</h3>
<p>New Features</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for Stack Exchange Redis strongly named assembly: StackExchange.Redis.StrongName.</li>
  <li>Added support for the "CustomSegmentTracerFactory" custom instrumentation option. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/instrumentation/net-custom-instrumentation">docs</a> for example usage.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/features/async-mode-net">Async mode</a>: Added support for NpgsqlCommand asynchronous methods (such as ExecuteReaderAsync) when the agent is in Async mode.</li>
  <li>Async mode: Explain plans for MS SQL and MySQL commands are now available when the agent is in Async mode.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Async mode: Fixed a bug that prevented SQL activity from being recorded in transactions.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where the incorrect namespace of the default asynchronous wrapper was used. The incorrect name was "NewRelic.Agent.Core.Wrapper.DefaultWrapperAsync" and is now "NewRelic.Providers.Wrapper.CustomInstrumentationAsync.DefaultWrapperAsync". Any customers that had created a custom instrumentation file and put the incorrect name in it as a workaround should change it to the correct name.</li>
  <li>Duplicate custom parameters will now be logged as Debug level, providing a minor performance improvement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For upgrade instructions, see <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent#updating_net">Upgrade the .NET agent</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, see <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrading-legacy-net-agents">Upgrading legacy .NET agents</a> for a list of major changes to the .NET agent.</li>
</ul>
