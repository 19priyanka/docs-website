<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>"newrelic-admin record_deploy" now functions with proxies.</strong></p>
    <p>The <code>newrelic-admin</code> record<em>deploy command previously did not function when a proxy was defined by the newrelic.ini configuration file or the `NEW_RELIC_PROXY</em>*` environment variables. This bug has now been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cross Application Tracing HTTP response headers were inserted on a 304 response</strong></p>
    <p>When cross application tracing is enabled and the agent received a HTTP request from an application utilizing cross application tracing, the agent may have inserted additional response headers on a 304 HTTP response. The agent will no longer insert headers on a 304 response.</p>
