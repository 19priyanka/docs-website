<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue in which setting "agent_enabled" to false in newrelic.yml caused an IncompatibleClassChangeError in the application on startup. The agent can now be disabled without side-effect.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the agent throws an exception if null keys or values are passed to the recordCustomEvent() API. The agent now ignores these null values.</li>
  <li>Fixed a rare issue where the agent throws a NullPointerException in the application during JDBC calls. The agent now reports these calls but may report an “Unknown” database.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where a VerifyError is thrown in the application code when using Spring or JAX-RS annotations on a Kotlin method with a default parameter.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where external HTTP metrics could be reported outside of a transaction when using HttpURLConnection. The agent now ignores these calls.</li>
</ul>
