<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">Update the Infrastructure agent</a> for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.</p>
<p>Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.</p>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Disk free/used percent now matches output from <code>df -h</code> on Linux.</li>
  <li>Docker container metadata now updates on a one-minute schedule. This will capture container changes such as restarts or container name changes.</li>
  <li>Payload compression for outgoing data will be turned on for all agents. To turn off compression, set the config setting <code>payload_compression_level</code> to 0.</li>
</ul>
