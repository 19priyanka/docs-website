<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Director instrumentation that will now name the transaction correctly, as well as create segments corresponding to the handlers registered with director.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transaction naming refactor - this should clear up some inconsistent naming issues in our router instrumentations.</p>
    <p>Previously the instrumentation was tasked with the maintenance of the transaction state name, now this has been abstracted into its own class to be used by instrumentations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Express instrumentation refactored to scope transaction storage to the incoming request object.</p>
    <p>Previously the express instrumentation used a stack to track which router was expecting middleware to finish and keep track of which transaction is being executed. The new implementation has a stronger guarantee on scoping work to the correct transaction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The agent now uses the correct units (was seconds, now milliseconds) for slow queries - this fixes and issue where query traces in the databases tab were slower than the reported maximum.</li>
</ul>
