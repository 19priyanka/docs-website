<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Add <code>:trace_only</code> option to <code>notice_error</code> API</p>
    <p>Previously, calling <code>notice_error</code> would record the trace, increment the error count, and consider the transaction failing for Apdex purposes. This method now accepts a <code>:trace_only</code> boolean option which, if true, will only record the trace and not affect the error count or transaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HTTP.rb support</p>
    <p>The agent has been updated to add instrumentation support for the HTTP gem, including Cross Application Tracing. Thanks Tiago Sousa for the contribution!</p>

  <li>
    <p>Prevent redundant Delayed::Job instrumentation installation</p>
    <p>This change was to handle situations where multiple Delayed::Worker instances are being created but Delayed::Job has already been instrumented. Thanks Tony Brown for the contribution!</p>
