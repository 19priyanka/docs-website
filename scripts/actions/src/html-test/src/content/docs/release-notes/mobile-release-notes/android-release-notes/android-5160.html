<h3>New in this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>MobileRequestError events now contain the response body returned in the network request response, if one exists. Response bodies will only be reported if the <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/api-guides/android-agent-configuration-feature-flags#ff-withHttpResponseBodyCaptureEnabled">withHttpResponseBodyCaptureEnabled feature flag</a> is enabled. HttpResponseBodyCapture is enabled by default. Response body data will be limited to the first 4096 bytes (the Insights attribute limit). A content type attribute will also be added to the event if a "content_type" header is found in the response.</li>
  <li>MobileRequestError events now also contain any cross-application tracing (CAT) data returned in the response headers. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/introduction-cross-application-traces">Introduction to cross-application traces</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

  <li>Proguard map detection of release variants when using AndroidStudio 3 has been restored.</li>
  <li>Add content type parameter missing from HTTP error traces when instrumenting OkHttp2, OkHttp3 and Retrofit requests.</li>
</ul>
