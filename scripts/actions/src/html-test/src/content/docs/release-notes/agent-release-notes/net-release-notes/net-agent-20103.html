<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>When enabling enterprise security (or High Security) in rpm applications either stop responding completely or the profiler will shut down due to security violation regardless of the ssl setting in newrelic.xml config.<br>High security requires that the newrelic.xml config have the attribute ssl in the service node set to "true," the enabled attribute in the requestParameters node set to "false" and the recordSQL attribute in the transactionTracer node to be set to "obfuscated." The .net Agent log now appropriately reflects the configuration needs and will gracefully stop the profiler if the configuration does not meet the requirements of High Security.</li>
  <li>If there are invalid characters in the newrelic.xml file, when the .NET Agent's DiagnosticTool is run, it throws an exception associated with the "DiagnosticCollectorAttachment". This is the name of a private function in the tool, and the tool just logs the message associated with the exception. The fix now allows the evaluation for an inner exception, where the more meaningful message can usually be found and recorded.</li>
  <li>Fix for a Null Reference Exception happening on rare occasions when recording metrics.</li>
</ul>
