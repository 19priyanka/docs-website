<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed an inverted <code>if</code> in config loading.</p>
    <p>Previously, the config loader would log a warning on success, rather than failure. Configuration loading works as expected now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in <code>process.nextTick</code> instrumentation for io.js 1.8.1.</p>
    <p>Previously the agent would only pass the callback argument to <code>process.nextTick</code>. This did not cause issues in Node.js and older version of io.js, since additional arguments were ignored. In a recent change to io.js, <code>process.nextTick</code> was changed to pass any additional arguments to the callback, the same way <code>setImmediate</code> does. This change ensures all arguments are handled as expected.</p>
