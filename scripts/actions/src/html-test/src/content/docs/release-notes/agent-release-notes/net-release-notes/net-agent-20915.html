<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Fixes</p>
<ul>
  <li>After deployment of a site, the site would throw a TypeLoadException "Could not load 'NewRelic.Agent.Core.AgentShim' from assembly mscorlib", because of a stale assembly token cache used within the agent.</li>
  <li>Segments in transactions for .NET MVC applications were being mis-labeled with System.Web.Mvc.ProcessRequest(async). This has been renamed to System.Web.Mvc.ProcessBeginRequest()[async] to reflect the actual name of the framework method being instrumented. This is because System.Web.Mvc.MvcHandler now implements IHttpAsyncHandler.</li>
</ul>
<p>Features changed</p>
<ul>
  <li>The agent installer will no longer allow users who are not administrators to complete the installation. This prevents the agent from being improperly installed.</li>
  <li>Turned off the metrics for the execution pipeline steps. The agent still generates transaction trace segments for the calls, so the user will still be able to diagnose the pipeline without the execution pipeline steps.</li>
</ul>
