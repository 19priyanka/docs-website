<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Performance improvements</p>
    <p>The Java agent now starts up to 50% faster. Your applications will be available that much sooner.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In some cases JAX-RS annotations on interfaces were not being observed, causing transactions using JAX-RS services to be named on the servlet rather than the web servicepath and method.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue that prevents Spray and Akka-HTTP instrumentation from applying when using Scala 2.10.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue that caused Play 2.x requests to produce empty responses when the circuit breaker is tripped.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where setting <code>enable_custom_tracing</code> to <code>false</code> could inadvertently disable Netty instrumentation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed in 3.29.0</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Applications that use Play and Ning AsyncHttpClient may miss transactions.</li>
      <li>The thread profiler may not report data while profiling certain Scala classes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed in 3.28.0</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug that could cause Akka Http instrumentation to throw a <code>NullPointerException</code> into customer code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed in 3.27.0</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed an issue where the agent treated HTTP headers as being case sensitive, causing CAT to miss under certain conditions.</li>
      <li>Fixed various issues related to the proper handling of multibyte character encoding.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed in 3.26.x</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CXF instrumentation can name transactions based on auto-generated proxy classes. Later agents now normalizes CXF transaction names.</li>
      <li>EJB instrumentation may cause a <code>NullPointerException</code> in application code, and erroneously set transaction names. In later versions, the agent records a metric.</li>
      <li>The Cross Application Tracing API caused Application Response time to be attributed to other transaction time, and prevented linking of transaction traces when doing CAT.</li>
      <li>Request queuing calculations could show queuing time as a steadily increasing value instead of the correct time.</li>
      <li>HttpURLConnection External metrics may not report on the IBM J9 JVM.</li>
      <li>Transaction traces may report external segments for non I/O calls in Apache HttpClient.</li>
      <li>The Java agent will now read Cross Application Tracing HTTP header names regardless of case.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug that could cause cross application tracing between the New Relic Java agent and non-Java New Relic agents to fail.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
