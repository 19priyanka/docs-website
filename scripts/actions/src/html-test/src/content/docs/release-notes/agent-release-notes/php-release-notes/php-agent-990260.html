<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Under some circumstances, Drupal 8 transactions were named after generic controllers. These names were not useful for troubleshooting.</p>
    <p>Drupal 8 transaction naming is now improved and hooks into Symfony routing to resolve the main controller associated with a route.</p>
  </li>
