<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Our long-awaited support for Joomla 2.x and 3.x have been added. The PHP agent now instruments and names Joomla transactions without the need for additional plugins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prevent injection of page load timing JavaScript when the Content-Type is first set to <strong>text/html</strong> then changed to something else, such as <strong>application/json</strong>.</li>
  <li>Fix Zend Framework transaction naming when <code>exit()</code> is called during request processing. Previously, it was possible to exit before the agent set the transaction name. This caused the transaction to be reported as <strong>index.php</strong>, an issue that most commonly occurs with the Redirect action helper. The agent now correctly names these transactions.</li>
  <li>Fix segfault triggered by JSON encoding when strings to be encoded are marked as UTF-8, yet contain invalid UTF-8 byte sequences.</li>
</ul>
