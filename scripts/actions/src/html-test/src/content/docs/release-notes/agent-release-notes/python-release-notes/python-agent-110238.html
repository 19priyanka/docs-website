<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This release of the Python agent fixes an issue when floating point values were used in headers used to calculate queueing time.</p>
<p>For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the <a href="https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent">status of the Python agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Bug fixes/Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When a float value was provided in the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start headers as the time stamp, it was not being parsed correctly and the fractional part was being discarded. This was resulting in loss off accuracy.</li>
</ul>
