<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Host shutdown detection in Windows and Linux (systemd only).</li>
  <li>As part of a feature to reduce Host Not Reporting alerts, the Agent will (try to) detect if a Host is being shutdown. There will be a new Inventory entry, agent/shutdown_status, with a value of either Running or Shutdown that will later be used by Alerts to decide if a HNR alert should be triggered or not.</li>
  <li>Verbose logging enablement from newrelic-infra-ctl for Windows.</li>
  <li>Improved agent identification</li>
</ul>
