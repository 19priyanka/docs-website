<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Corrects WKWebView instrumentation bug that results in the NavigationDelegate method, <code>webView:didCommitNavigation:</code> being called instead of <code>webView:didStartProvisionalNavigation:</code>. This would result in a crash if the former is implemented in the delegate, but the latter is not.</li>
