<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We will be removing the <code>core_20</code> directory from the download site the week of September 3rd, 2018 as it contains a deprecated version of the .Net Core agent. Please be sure to update any of your scripts that reference this location accordingly.
    <ul>
      <li>All downloads for the current version of the agent can be found in the <code>latest_release</code> directory on the download site.</li>
      <li>Historical versions can be found in the <code>previous_releases</code> directory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/update-net-agent">update the .NET agent</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents">upgrade legacy .NET agents</a>.</li>
</ul>
