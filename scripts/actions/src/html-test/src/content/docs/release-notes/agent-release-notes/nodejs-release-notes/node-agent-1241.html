<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Error totals are now reported.</p>
    <p>The agent now reports metrics that reflect the total number of errors that have occurred in web and background transactions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Disabling SSL no longer requires the setting of a port.</p>
    <p>Previously, the agent required changing <code>port</code> in the config to <code>80</code> when disabling SSL. The agent will now default to port 80 if a port is not supplied and SSL is turned off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Logging functions have been improved.</p>
    <p>The agent will now properly log error stack traces and can rate limit logging messages. To aid in debugging we have provided more logging about the public API.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
