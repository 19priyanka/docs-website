<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Security Bulletin <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr17-06">NR17-06</a>: Fixes issue where query parameters were being included in the URL property of transaction trace segments for external calls (uses of System.Net.HttpClient, System.Net.WebRequest, or third-party libraries which are built on top of those). Query parameters will no longer be included in transaction trace segments.</li>
  <li>Transaction names will be rolled up for web transactions resulting in a 400 or 500 level HTTP status code and a higher priority name has not been set. This helps prevent <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/metric-grouping-issues">metric grouping issues</a>.</li>
  <li>Fixed error that could result in the one time loss of a metric and/or transaction for an instrumentation point at the start of monitoring an application. "...NewRelic ERROR: Tracer invocation error: System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added. Key: ..."</li>
  <li>Minor log level adjustments in the profiler logging. Suppresses benign error <code>Failed to tokenize method signature: class System.Reflection.Assembly System.CannotUnloadAppDomainException::LoadAssemblyOrThrow(string)</code></li>
  <li><strong>[.NET Core 2.0]</strong> For .NET Core agent users on Linux, this release fixes a problem with the <code>run.sh</code> convenience script in combination with a custom installation path.</li>
  <li><strong>[.NET Framework]</strong> Fixes issue resulting in SerializationExceptions when using .Net Remoting.</li>
