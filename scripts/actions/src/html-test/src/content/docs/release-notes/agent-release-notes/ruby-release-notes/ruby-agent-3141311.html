<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Add support for setting a display name on hosts</p>
    <p>You can now configure a display name for your hosts using <code>process_host.display_name</code>, to more easily distinguish dynamically assigned hosts. For more info, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/add-rename-remove-hosts#display_name">Change display name of hosts</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Fixes automatic middleware instrumentation for Puma 2.12.x</p>
    <p>Starting with version 2.12.x the Puma project inlines versions of <code>Rack::Builder</code> and <code>Rack::URLMap</code> under the Puma namespace. This had the unfortunate side effect of breaking automatic Rack middleware instrumentation. We now instrument <code>Puma::Rack::Builder</code> and <code>Puma::Rack::URLMap</code> and once again have automatic Rack middleware instrumentation for applications running on Puma.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not use a DelayedJob's <code>display_name</code> for naming the transaction</p>
    <p>A DelayedJob's name may be superseded by a <code>display_name</code>, which can lead to a metric grouping issue if the <code>display_name</code> contains unique identifiers. We no longer use job name methods that may lead to an arbitrary <code>display_name</code>. Instead, we use the appropriate class and/or method names, depending what makes sense for the job and how it's called.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improvements to Mongo 2.1.x instrumentation</p>
    <p>Fixes issue where <code>getMore</code> operations in batched queries could create metric grouping issues. Previously when multiple Mongo queries executed in the same scope only a single query was recorded as part of a transaction trace. Now transaction trace nodes will be created for every query executed during a transaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for <code>NewRelic::Agent.notice_error</code></p>
    <p>Fixes issue introduced in v3.14.0 where calling <code>NewRelic::Agent.notice_error</code> outside of an active transaction results in a <code>NoMethodError</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for Resque Transaction Error events</p>
    <p>Fixes error preventing Transaction Error events generated in Resque tasks from being sent to New Relic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
