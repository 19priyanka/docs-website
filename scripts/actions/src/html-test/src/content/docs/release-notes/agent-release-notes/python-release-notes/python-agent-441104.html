<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The creation of sampled events sometimes raised an exception in Python 3</strong></p>
    <p>When more events (Transaction, Transaction Error, Custom, or Span) were created than allowed per harvest period in Python 3, sometimes a <code>TypeError: '&#x3C;' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'dict'</code> was raised. This issue has now been fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
