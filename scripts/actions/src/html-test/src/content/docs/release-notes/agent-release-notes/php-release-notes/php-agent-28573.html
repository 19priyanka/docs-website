<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Considerably more detailed transaction traces, reducing to almost nil the amount of "uninstrumented time" in TT graphs.</li>
  <li>Detailed TT's (the so-called "top100" feature) are now enabled by default.</li>
  <li>Reduced the overhead for detailed TT's dramatically, bringing it to within 2-3% of the agent speed without them enabled.</li>
  <li>Fixed a memory bug that was causing garbage metric names to be sent to the daemon and then on to RPM.</li>
  <li>Fixed erroneous behavior of the "newrelic_end_of_transaction()" API call. Previously it did not correctly end the transaction.</li>
  <li>The fix to reduce metric grouping issues with WordPress table names no longer causes the table names to produce a warning in the logfile.</li>
</ul>
