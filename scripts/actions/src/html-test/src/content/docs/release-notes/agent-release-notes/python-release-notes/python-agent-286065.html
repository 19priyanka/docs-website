<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent includes improvements to our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications as well as bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>New Feature</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tornado 4 Outbound Cross Application Tracing</strong></p>
    <p>Tornado 4 <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/cross-application-tracing">Cross Application Tracing</a> is now supported for outbound web transactions. In addition to Service Maps, Tornado 4 transaction traces will now contain links to the application it called. With this update, Cross Application Tracing is now fully supported for Tornado 4 applications.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Django 1.10+ browser monitoring with new-style gzip middleware</strong></p>
    <p>Browser monitoring was not automatically inserted when using new style Django 1.10+ gzip middleware. Browser monitoring code is now inserted as expected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Using motor versions 1.X generated instrumentation errors</strong></p>
    <p>Motor 1.0 removed the MotorReplicaSetClient class which resulted in the New Relic Python Agent generating an instrumentation error when attempting to access that class. The instrumentation has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
