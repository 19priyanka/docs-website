<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent includes a bug fix for our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ending Tornado 4 transactions inside of a traced function results in an internal agent error</strong></p>
    <p>Ending a Tornado 4 web transaction within a traced function previously resulted in the generation of an agent traceback. The agent now completes tracing the function before ending the transaction, resulting in the correct reporting of these transactions to New Relic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
