<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for recording interfaces that return promises instead of taking callbacks. See <code>RecorderSpec.promise</code> for more details.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Gert Sallaerts (@Gertt) for this contribution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Incorporated fixes and features from 1.36.2, 1.37.0, and 1.37.1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Domains are no longer preemptively instrumented, thus applications that do not use domains will not load the domain module.</p>
    <p>Including the domain module causes a small amount of extra overhead in other core libraries that must keep the domain state set correctly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
