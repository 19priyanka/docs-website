<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Removed client support of the RC4 stream cipher for communicating with the New Relic servers.</p>
    <p>The RC4 cipher is considered unsafe and is generally being deprecated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix for logging version number in Express instrumentation. Thanks @tregagnon.</p>
    <p>When an unsupported version of Express is detected, we log a message that contains the Express version number. The version is a string and was being logged as a number, resulting in NaN in the log message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agent is now more safe when recording memory stats.</p>
    <p>Previously, the agent would crash the process as it was gathering memory usage information (i.e. when process.memoryUsage threw an error). This defect is now guarded against with a try-catch.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
