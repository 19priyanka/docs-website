<h3>Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug which caused some applications that use Play and Ning AsyncHttpClient to miss transactions.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue which would cause the thread profiler to not report data while profiling some Scala classes.</li>
  <li>Fixed a rare bug where a RuntimeException is thrown during class transformation which can prevent some instrumentation from being applied.</li>
  <li>Fixes a rare case where Tomcat ClassLoaders could leak memory when using a JDBC driver bundled in your application after reloading a web application.</li>
</ul>
