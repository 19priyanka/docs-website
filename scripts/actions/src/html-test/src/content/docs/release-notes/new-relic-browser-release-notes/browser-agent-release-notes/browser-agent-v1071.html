<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The Browser agent, sometimes called the JavaScript agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.</p>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Link JS Errors to Browser Interactions (relevant only for PRO+SPA):</strong> When a JS error occurs inside a browser interaction event, the error will now be associated with the interaction via Insights attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events will now have the following attributes: <code>browserInteractionId</code>, <code>eventId</code>, and <code>parentEventId</code>.</p>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>JSONP Tracking Breaks in some versions of Safari (relevant only for PRO+SPA):</strong> Previously, the agent would cause Safari browsers to lock up when JSONP requests returned large data. The agent no longer calculates JSONP response size.</li>
</ul>
