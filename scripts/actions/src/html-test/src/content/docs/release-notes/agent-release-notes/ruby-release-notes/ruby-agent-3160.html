    <p>Obfuscate queries from <code>oracle_enhanced</code> adapter correctly</p>

    <p>Make it possible to define a newrelic_role for deployment with Capistrano 3</p>

  <li>
    <p>Retry initial connection to New Relic in Resque master if needed</p>
    <p>Previously, if the initial connection to New Relic in a monitored Resque master process failed, the agent would not retry, and monitoring for the process would be lost. This has been fixed, and the agent will continue retrying in its background harvest thread until it successfully connects.</p>
