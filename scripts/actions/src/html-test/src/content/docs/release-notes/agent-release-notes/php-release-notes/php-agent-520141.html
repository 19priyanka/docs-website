<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>On Linux, abstract sockets are now supported for agent to daemon communication. An abstract socket can be created by prefixing the value of the port setting in your newrelic.ini file (e.g. <code>newrelic.daemon.port = "@newrelic-daemon"</code>) or newrelic.cfg file (e.g. <code>port = "@newrelic-daemon"</code>).</li>
  <li>The daemon can now be passed a <code>--define &#x3C;setting>=&#x3C;value></code> flag that allows setting arbitrary parameters from your newrelic.cfg file. These parameters will take precedence over settings from that file.</li>
  <li>Drupal 8 requests that are successful full page cache hits for anonymous users (handled by Drupal\page_cache\StackMiddleware\PageCache) are now given the name WebTransaction/Action/page_cache.</li>
  <li>Support for automatically naming transactions has been added for Symfony 2.8 and 3.0.</li>
  <li>Support for automatically naming transactions has been added for MediaWiki 1.18.0 and newer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrade Notices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is now possible to disable reporting of errors for exceptions that are handled by an exception handler installed with <code>set_exception_handler()</code> by enabling the <code>newrelic.error_collector.ignore_user_exception_handler</code> setting.</li>
  <li>Calls to newrelic_notice_error with improper parameters will no longer record an error with the message "?". Instead, no error will be recorded. newrelic_notice_error will now return true if an error is saved, null if the arguments are invalid, and false otherwise. If newrelic_notice_error is called with two parameters and the second parameter is not a valid exception, no error will be recorded: The first parameter is now entirely unused.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>On Redhat Enterprise Linux 7 and related systems such as CentOS and Fedora, the <code>systemctl start|stop newrelic-daemon</code> commands were not working due to a bug in the newrelic-daemon init script when executed by systemd. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>On some Linux systems, an SELinux policy could prevent the newrelic-daemon from determining the correct hostname. Affected systems were unable to report data because a valid hostname is required by New Relic. This has been fixed. This issue could also prevent the newrelic-daemon from determining the correct hostname when running in a chrooted environment, or any environment in which access to the /proc filesystem is limited.</li>
  <li>Detection of Zend Framework 2.5 and later was unreliable when the framework was installed via Composer. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Detection of Laravel 5.1 and later was unreliable when <code>artisan optimize</code> was used. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>The agent now sends the attribute <code>request.headers.contentLength</code> as an integer rather than a string.</li>
</ul>
