<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent improves our introductory support for Tornado 4 applications by adding <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/cross-application-tracing">Cross Application Tracing</a> for web transactions that are sent to a Tornado 4 application.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>New Feature</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tornado 4 applications will now appear in Service Maps</strong></p>
    <p>Tornado 4 <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/cross-application-tracing">Cross Application Tracing</a> is now supported for inbound web transactions. In addition to Service Maps, the calling application's APM will now have links to the Tornado 4 application it called in the External Services tab and in Transaction Traces.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Record exceptions outside of view handlers in Django 1.10</strong></p>
    <p>Unhandled exceptions that occurred outside of a view handler in Django 1.10 were not reported. In addition to middleware exceptions, these unhandled exceptions can be generated when a view handler returns a TemplateResponse and rendering that template would result in an exception.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consistent WSGI/Application and WSGI/Response segments</strong></p>
    <p>Prior to this release, the agent would group segments under <code>WSGI/Application</code> and <code>WSGI/Response</code> differently, depending on whether or not <a href="https://newrelic.com/browser-monitoring">browser monitoring</a> was enabled. This has now been made consistent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improved New Relic WSGI middleware behavior</strong></p>
    <p>The New Relic agent is now resilient when called by non-conforming middleware. Transactions will continue to be reported normally when the New Relic agent is called by WSGI middleware that does not call the close() method as described in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333">PEP 333</a> specification.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
