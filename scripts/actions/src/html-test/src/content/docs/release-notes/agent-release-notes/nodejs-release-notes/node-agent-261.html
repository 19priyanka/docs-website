<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added regression test for promise instrumentation and stack overflows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed naming bug in Restify instrumentation regarding parameters to <code>next</code>.</p>
    <p>The instrumentation previously considered any truthy value passed to <code>next</code> to be an error. It is possible to pass a string or boolean to <code>next</code> in Restify to control further routing of the request. This would cause the middleware's mounting path to be erroneously appended to the transaction name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed access to <code>bluebird.coroutine.addYieldHandler</code>.</p>
    <p>This was accidentally not copied by our instrumentation making access to the function fail. This has been resolved and tests expanded to ensure no other properties were missed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
