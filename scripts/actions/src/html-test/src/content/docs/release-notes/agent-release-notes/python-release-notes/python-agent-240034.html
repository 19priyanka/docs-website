<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This release of the Python agent enables the collection of transaction traces for Synthetics requests by default, and adds the individual trip trace visualization for Cross Application Tracing.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from our <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>
<p>For a list of known issues with the Python agent, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent">Status of the Python agent</a>.</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cross Application Tracing for individual transactions</strong></p>
    <p>Version 2.38.0.31 of the Python agent introduced aggregated transaction maps. In this release, we have built on that feature to add the ability to view an end-to-end visualization of an individual transaction, in order to better understand what backend applications and external services were called during the course of a single transaction.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Features Changed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Synthetics support enabled by default</strong></p>
    <p>When the Python agent added support for the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/collecting-synthetic-transaction-traces">collection of transaction traces for Synthetics requests</a> in version 2.32.0.28, the feature had to be explicitly enabled in the agent configuration file. With this release, support for Synthetics is enabled by default.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Non ASCII characters in transaction names</strong></p>
    <p>If a transaction name contained a Unicode character outside of the ASCII range, the generation of the cross application tracing attributes would result in a UnicodeEncodeError. This bug affected versions 2.38.0.31 through 2.38.2.33. The issue is fixed in the current release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Parsing SQL statements referencing the database schema</strong></p>
    <p>Previously, SQL statements that referenced a table from a database schema namespace, such as “schema.table_name”, would not always be parsed correctly, resulting in the table being identified as just “schema”. The agent now handles this case correctly, and the table is reported as “schema.table_name”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Additional support for Tornado 1.X</strong></p>
    <p>If Tornado 1.X was being used, the instrumentation would fail at run time causing all web requests to fail. Monitoring of Tornado 1.X applications should now work correctly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
