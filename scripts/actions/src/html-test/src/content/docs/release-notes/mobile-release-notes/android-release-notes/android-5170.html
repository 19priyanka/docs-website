<h3>New in this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Added instrumentation support for Android Instant Apps</strong>
    The agent now detects and instruments all feature modules for an instant app. Because instant apps are typically side-loaded, users must add NewRelic.start() calls to each entry point activity in the module. We've also created a document to help integrate the agent into your Instant App. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/install-new-relic-plugin-android-instant-apps">Install the New Relic plugin for Android Instant Apps</a> for more information.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed in this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Correctly restore any pre-existing unhandled exception handler when the agent shuts downs. Maintain the state of existing unhandled exception handlers when the agent returns to foreground.</li>
  <li>Fixed instrumentation of abstract classes derived from Android SDK classes.</li>
  <li>Fixed instrumentation failure when using certain Java 8 features, such as lambdas.</li>
  <li>Updated instrumentation support for Dexguard 8 on Android Studio 3.0.</li>
  <li>Enforce @SkipTrace with Android SDK-derived classes. Previously, onCreate() and onCreateView() could not be skipped from Activity, Fragment and other SDK classes.</li>
</ul>
