<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This release of the Python agent addresses a bug which in some cases caused database connection parameters, which could include login credentials, to be logged to the local system by the monitored application if Python agent debug logging is being captured.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from our <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>
<p>For a list of known issues with the Python agent see our online help article on the <a href="https://newrelic.com/docs/python/status-of-python-agent">status of the Python agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When Python agent debug logging was enabled by setting <code>log_level</code> to <code>debug</code> in the Python agent configuration, database connection details, including login credentials could be logged in the local Python agent log file.</p>
    <p>The details may also have been logged even if <code>log_level</code> had not been set to <code>debug</code>, but the Python logging module had been configured to collect and log messages logged at the log level of <code>logging.DEBUG</code>.</p>
    <p>This issue was introduced in version 2.20.0.17 of the Python agent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
