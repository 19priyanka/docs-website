<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Distributed tracing</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.</p>
<p>Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing">transition guide</a> before you enable this feature.</p>
<p>To enable distributed tracing, set enabled to true in the <code>distributed_tracing</code> stanza in the newrelic.yml config file.</p>
<pre><code>distributed_tracing:
    enabled: true
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li>Added configuration option <code>proxy_scheme</code> to allow the agent to connect via https only proxies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue where transaction throughput counts could be artificially inflated when using async servlets in Jersey.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where JBoss and Wildfly datasources could cause a <code>LinkageError</code>.</li>
</ul>
