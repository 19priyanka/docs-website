<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed issue with when.js instrumentation not preserving all properties on wrapped Promise constructor.</p>
    <p>Previously, the when.js instrumentation would cause an unhandled exception when private methods on the Promise constructor were called (e.g. when adapting functions that do not use promises).</p>
