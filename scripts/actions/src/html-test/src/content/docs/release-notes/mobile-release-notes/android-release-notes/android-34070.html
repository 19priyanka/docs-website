<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><strong>Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>API methods now check for bad values and throw IllegalArgumentException</p>
    <p>Previously, our API methods would silently discard bad data without recording errors or metrics. We've changed this behavior to be more informative by throwing an exception when bad arguments are passed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Android Gradle plugin 0.10 compatibility</p>
    <p>Version 0.10.0 of the plugin introduced a subtle change that caused errors during build time that would produce ClassCastException errors at runtime. Weâ€™ve fixed this issue and verified we're also compatible with 0.11.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved thread safety in the API</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some API methods exhibited race conditions under heavy utilization. These race conditions are now solved.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Summary metrics occasionally exhibited bad values</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may have noticed strange numbers in your application overview chart. We've isolated the cause of these numbers and fixed the underlying issue in the agent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
