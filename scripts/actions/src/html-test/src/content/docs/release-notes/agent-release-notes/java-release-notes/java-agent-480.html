<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the agent would break webpage rendering by inserting New Relic Browser monitoring javascript into the <code>&#x3C;header></code> tag of pages which were missing <code>&#x3C;head></code> tags.</li>
  <li>Certain frameworks, like Spring Cloud Gateway, triggered a bug in the Spring webflux instrumentation, causing transactions to stay open until they timed out. This bug resulted in more memory pressure and looked like a memory leak. This has been fixed in this release.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the agent would stop reporting to New Relic following a ForceDisconnectException and accumulate transaction data resulting in OutOfMemory Exceptions.</li>
  <li>The agent now validates that app_names only contains three application names. If the agent is configured to report more than three application names, the agent will log a warning message and stop reporting to New Relic.</li>
  <li>When a custom WSRequestFilter is used that modifies an outbound play-ws request, the agent would report overly long segments due to Segment timeouts and will also result in a loss of External/ metrics. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
