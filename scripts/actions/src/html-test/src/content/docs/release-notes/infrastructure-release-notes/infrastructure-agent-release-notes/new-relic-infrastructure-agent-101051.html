<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add new improved Windows Storage Sampler based on PDH instead of WMI. This new sampler is faster and more reliable; it is activated by default, to revert to the old one you can set the <code>legacy_storage_sampler</code> option to <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix a bug where some inventory items could disappear.</li>
  <li>Fix bug with <code>strip_command_line=true</code> that could cause some processes to be discarded in the samples.</li>
  <li>Fix bug that prevented some inventory items from updating their state when asked for a full reset.</li>
</ul>
