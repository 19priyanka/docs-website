<h2>New in this release</h2>
<h3>Improved attribute validation</h3>
<p>The agent will no longer reject events containing invalid attributes. Attributes that fail basic event validation are pruned from the map of provided event attributes. We've also corrected an event creation error where attribute maps containing <code>null</code> keys would result in events with a subset of passed attributes.</p>
<p>This applies to attributes passed to<code>recordCustomEvent()</code>, <code>recordEvent()</code> and <code>recordBreadCrumb()</code> API methods.</p>
<h3>Map uploads are now compressed by default</h3>
<p>To disable compressed uploads, add the following to the <code>newrelic.properties</code>:</p>
<pre><code>com.newrelic.compressed_uploads=false
</code></pre>
<h2>Fixed in this release</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes the <code>java.lang.LinkageError</code> runtime crash when instrumenting OkHttp 4.9</li>
  <li>Fixed <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> thrown during builds when the agent inspects classes compiled with JDK 9 and higher. Classes compiled with JDK 9 through JDK 11 are now inspected for instrumentation</li>
</ul>
