<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hapi handlers will now preserve the defaults associated with them.</p>
    <p>Previously when wrapping handlers, the agent would drop the associated defaults on the ground, these are now properly forwarded to the wrapper. Big thanks to Sean Parmelee (@seanparmelee) for finding the root cause of this bug and reporting it!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed starting the agent with an invalid process version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pinned <code>request</code> version for testing old versions of Node.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added tests for feature flags created at agent initialization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
