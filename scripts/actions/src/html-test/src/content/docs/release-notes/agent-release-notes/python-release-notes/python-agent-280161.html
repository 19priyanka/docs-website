<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to address a problem with the Tornado 4 instrumentation for <code>curl_httpclient</code> introduced in our last release (v2.80.0.60). Under the circumstances described below, calling <code>CurlAsyncHTTPClient.fetch_impl()</code> could result in an agent error.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from our <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>
<h3>Bug Fix</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix CurlAsyncHTTPClient.fetch_impl() instrumentation</strong></p>
    <p>If <code>fetch_impl()</code> was called by passing the <code>request</code> argument positionally, but passing <code>callback</code> as a keyword argument, then the agent would throw an error. In practice, this only affected customers who implemented a custom version of <code>fetch_impl()</code>, but for those affected customers, this is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
