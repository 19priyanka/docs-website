<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The agent will now report garbage collection statistics on supported platforms.</p>
    <p>On node versions 0.10, 0.12, 4, 6, and 7 the agent will now record the time spent in, the number of, and type of garbage collection cycles. You can read more about it on <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/node-vm-measurements">our docs site!</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The agent no longer double counts MySQL query times when using a connection pool.</p>
    <p>Previously, when using a pool of connections a query done through the pool would be recorded as the time it took on the pool, as well as the connection, effectively counting the time twice. This is no longer the case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agent will no longer lose transaction state across Bluebird's <code>promise.nodify</code>.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Matt Lavin (@mdlavin) for this contribution!</p>
