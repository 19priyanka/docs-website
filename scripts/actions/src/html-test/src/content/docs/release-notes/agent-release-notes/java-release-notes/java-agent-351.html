<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Auto-RUM bug</p>
    <p>Starting in version 3.5.0 of the Java agent, in rare cases Auto-RUM could cause the New Relic header to be placed within a script tag. This bug has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: In rare cases, agent stops reporting</p>
    <p>In rare cases, the Java Agent hung on socketRead while performing an SSL handshake and would not report data until JVM restart. This bug has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Occasionally missed web transaction when using ResultSet</p>
    <p>In version 3.5.0 of the agent some transactions that use a JDBC ResultSet were missing in the UI. The agent log would show an "Inconsistent State" error. This bug has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: X-Ray Sessions bugs.</p>
    <p>X-Ray Sessions sometimes returned no transaction traces. A memory leak with X-Ray Sessions when many sessions were run was also fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
