<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">Update the Infrastructure agent</a> for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.</p>
<p>Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Windows AppData for all data cache, user_data, and integration related temp files. The log file is also written to %AppData%/New Relic/newrelic-infra/...instead of the Program Files location.</li>
  <li>Integrations can now invoke executables from the system path without using an absolute path to them, and the value of $PATH is passed through to integration executables</li>
  <li>For agents deployed inside containers, the Linux distribution and version will now reflect the parent host rather than the OS within the container itself</li>
</ul>
