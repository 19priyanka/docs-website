<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rails 5.2 support</p>
    <p>The Ruby agent has been validated against the latest release of Ruby on Rails!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for newer libraries and frameworks</p>
    <p>We have updated the multiverse suite to test the agent against current versions of several frameworks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add <code>custom_attributes.enabled</code> configuration option</p>
    <p>This option is enabled by default. When it's disabled, custom attributes will not be transmitted on transaction events or error events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix Grape load order dependency</p>
    <p>The agent will now choose the correct name for Grape transactions even if the customer's app loads the agent before Grape. Thanks to Daniel Doubrovkine for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add <code>webpacker:compile</code> to blacklisted tasks</p>
    <p><code>webpacker:compile</code> is commonly used for compiling assets. It has been added to <code>AUTOSTART_BLACKLISTED_RAKE_TASKS</code> in the default configuration. Thanks to Claudio B. for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make browser instrumentation W3C-compliant</p>
    <p><code>type="text/javascript"</code> is optional for the <code>&#x3C;script></code> tag under W3C. The <code>type</code> attribute has now been removed from browser instrumentation. Thanks to Spharian for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deferred <code>add_method_tracer</code> calls</p>
    <p>If a third-party library calls <code>add_method_tracer</code> before the agent has finished starting, we now queue these calls and run them when it's safe to do so (rather than skipping them and logging a warning).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for Resque <code>around</code> / <code>before</code> hooks</p>
    <p>In rare cases, the agent was not instrumenting Resque <code>around</code> and <code>before</code> hooks. This version fixes the error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Truncation of long stack traces</p>
    <p>Occasionally, long stack traces would cause complications sending data to New Relic. This version truncates long traces to 50 frames (split evenly between the top and bottom of the trace).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
