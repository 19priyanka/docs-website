<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Triaged a defect in native promise instrumentation</p>
    <p>Transactions used to be lost acrossed chained <code>.then</code> calls. The way promises are wrapped has been changed to fix this issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for Slow Queries</p>
    <p>Slow Query information will now appear in the UI for Node agent users. This feature allows you to see a trace for slow datastore queries. Read more about this feature in our <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/viewing-slow-query-details">documentation</a></p>
