<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS Agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.</p>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Add support for keyboard change events [Pro+SPA]:</strong> Keyboard events will now automatically trigger a Browser Interaction timing.</li>
  <li><strong>Browser Timing Events now have Traced Callback Duration [Pro+SPA]</strong>: In order to match the attributes on other New Relic Browser related events, the Browser Timing events now include callback durations by default.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Change harvest to not use sendBeacon</strong>: We now use the <code>sendBeacon</code> native API only for page unload. The agent will now attempt to use an XHR when available and save <code>sendBeacon</code> for <code>unload</code> events, in order to reduce the data transferred using the sendBeacon API.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>To upgrade your agent to the latest version, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/upgrade-browser-agent">Upgrade Browser agent</a>.</p>
