<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix a crash when using future-based interfaces on Tornado's http client</strong></p>
    <p>Tornado's http client returns a future when fetch is called. Prior to this release, the agent caused a coroutine object to be returned rather than a future, causing a potential crash when application code assumed a future would be returned. A future will now be returned from http client fetch as expected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix a crash when running a coroutine created in another transaction</strong></p>
    <p>When running a coroutine outside of the transaction that created it, the agent may have crashed if a separate transaction was active.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
