<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In some cases, the trace breakdown table overreported segment times. This happened when these three conditions were met, 1. instrumentation occurred through custom XML files, 2. the segment name was overridden, and 3. the segment contained child segments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-net-agent">upgrade the .NET agent</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are upgrading from a particularly old agent, review the list of major changes and procedures to <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/upgrade-legacy-net-agents">upgrade legacy .NET agents</a>.</li>
</ul>
