<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ignore Errors</p>
    <p>A new <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-err-ignore-errors"><code>newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors</code></a> setting has been added. When configured, this setting can be used to prevent errors, such as <code>E_WARNING</code>, from being reported to New Relic. This setting does not affect errors reported via the <code>newrelic_notice_error</code> API.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ignore Exceptions</p>
    <p>A new <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-err-ignore-exceptions"><code>newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions</code></a> setting has been added. This setting accepts a comma-separated list of fully-qualified class names. When an uncaught exception occurs, the agent will not report the exception to New Relic if it is an instance of a class in this list. This setting does not affect errors reported via the <code>newrelic_notice_error</code> API.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrade Notices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Guzzle support is now enabled by default. It can be disabled by setting the new <code>newrelic.guzzle.enabled</code> setting to false.</p>
    <p>The <code>guzzle</code> feature flag that was previously used to enable Guzzle support is now ignored.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The first request in each PHP process would remove any output handlers installed using the <code>output_handler</code> configuration setting for users of PHP 5.4 and later. This has been fixed: existing output handlers will now remain untouched.</li>
  <li>Transient WordPress hooks now have the unique numbers removed from their names to avoid metric grouping issues.</li>
  <li>In cases where WordPress' WP_CONTENT_DIR directory was set to a custom value, WordPress plugin metrics were not reported on PHP 5.2 to 5.4, inclusive. This affected users of the popular WP-Skeleton project. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>A regression in version 6.3 could cause Guzzle 6 users to lose support for cross application tracing and service maps, in particular when Guzzle 6 was autoloaded as a result of instantiating the only <code>GuzzleHttp\Client</code> object used within the lifetime of the script. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
