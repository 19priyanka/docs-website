<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent includes support for a new product called Infinite Tracing, and it also has some bug fixes</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>New Feature</h2>
<p>This release adds support for <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing">Infinite Tracing</a>. Infinite Tracing observes 100% of your distributed traces and provides visualizations for the most actionable data. With Infinite Tracing, you get examples of errors and long-running traces so you can better diagnose and troubleshoot your systems.</p>
<p>Configure your agent to send traces to a trace observer in New Relic Edge. View distributed traces through New Relicâ€™s UI. There is no need to install a collector on your network.</p>
<p>Infinite Tracing is currently available on a sign-up basis. If you would like to participate, please contact your sales representative.</p>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix record transaction failure in async applications</strong></p>
    <p>When the agent attempted to record information as part of event loop diagnostics, an AttributeError may have occurred during the record transaction phase causing data to not be recorded for that transaction. This issue has now been fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
