<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>SSL connections to New Relic are now mandatory</p>
    <p>Prior to this version, using an SSL connection to New Relic was the default behavior, but could be overridden. SSL connections are now enforced (not overrideable).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional security checking before trying to explain multi-statement SQL queries</p>
    <p>Customer applications might submit SQL queries containing multiple statements (e.g., SELECT * FROM table; SELECT * FROM table). For security reasons, we should not generate explain plans in this situation.</p>
    <p>Although the agent correctly skipped explain plans for these queries during testing, we have added extra checks for this scenario.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for RabbitMQ exchange names that are symbols</p>
    <p>The agent no longer raises a TypeError when a RabbitMQ exchange name is a Ruby symbol instead of a string.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for audit logging to stdout</p>
    <p>Previous agents configured to log to stdout would correctly send regular agent logs to stdout, but would incorrectly send audit logs to a text file named "stdout". This release corrects the error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for Capistrano deployment notifications on v3.7 and beyond</p>
    <p>Starting with version 3.7, Capistrano uses a different technique to determine a project's version control system. The agent now works correctly with this new behavior. Thanks to Jimmy Zhang for the contribution.</p>
