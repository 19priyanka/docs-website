<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Promise based web framework middleware instrumentation now supports callback based sequencing.</p>
    <p>Previously, a promise based middleware was assumed to continue to the next middleware once the promise it returned resolved. This assumption has been relaxed to allow for a callback to be supplied to the middleware to invoke the next middleware.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
