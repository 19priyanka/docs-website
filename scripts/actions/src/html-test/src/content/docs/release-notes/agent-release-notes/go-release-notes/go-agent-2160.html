<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue in the <a href="http://godoc.org/github.com/newrelic/go-agent/_integrations/nrhttprouter">nrhttprouter</a> integration where the transaction was not being added to the requests context. This resulted in an inability to access the transaction from within an <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter#Handle">httprouter.Handle</a> function. This issue has now been fixed.</li>
