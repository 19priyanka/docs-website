<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New feature: slow SQL. This is very similar to transaction traces but instead records the 10 slowest SQL statements, along with a stack trace of where the SQL was executed from in your program.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the automatic insertion of RUM headers and footers where they could sometimes be inserted multiple times (especially the footer).</li>
  <li>The "Drupal Modules" feature can now be enabled and disabled on a per-directory basis like most other configuration settings.</li>
  <li>A few minor bug fixes that had the potential for causing random agent crashes, although these were very infrequent.</li>
</ul>
