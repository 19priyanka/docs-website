<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for Label Categories</p>
    <p>The agent now supports setting Labels for your application on a per instance level, using either an environment variable, or a config file setting. <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/categories-rollups-organizing-your-apps-servers">https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/categories-...</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved transaction names for express 4</p>
    <p>express 4 added the ability to mount apps and routers at specific urls. The node agent would previously use only the portion of the route that was the last router or app matched as the transaction name. Transaction names will now include the entire matched route.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added detection for uninstrumented instances of modules that should be instrumented</p>
    <p>The agent will now detect if an application has required a module before <code>require('newrelic')</code> .If this occurs, the agent will add a warning in the log file and display a warning banner in the UI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added more logging to custom instrumentation APIs at <code>debug</code> level.</p>
    <p>The logging was improved for the benefit of people using the following APIs: <code>createTracer</code>, <code>createWebTransaction</code>, <code>createBackgroundTransaction</code>, and <code>endTransaction</code>. It will log when transactions are created and when transactions are ended. It will also log when it can't create a tracer due to there being no active transaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in PostgreSQL instrumentation where the event emitter from <code>query</code> could not chain <code>.on</code> calls. This patch was contributed by <a href="https://github.com/sebastianhoitz">sebastianhoitz</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in <code>createBackgroundTransaction</code> where if the agent was disabled it didn't take a <code>group</code> argument. This patch was contributed by <a href="https://github.com/nullvariable">nullvariable</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in our URL parsing where in Node v0.11.14 <code>url.parse</code> returns a differently shaped object than expected. This patch was contributed by <a href="https://github.com/atomantic">atomantic</a></p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Node v0.11.x is not officially supported, but Node v0.12 will be and this patch helps us get ready for that.</p>
