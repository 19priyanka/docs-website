<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>gRPC</li>
</ul>
<p>This release fixes two bugs in the Java agent's gRPC instrumentation. We highly recommend customers using gRPC instrumentation to upgrade to this and or later agent versions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>References to transaction segments were not being removed correctly, which can cause a memory leak</li>
  <li>The agent could cause the gRPC server listeners to fail to execute its <code>completed</code> and/or <code>cancelled</code> methods, which can cause unexpected behavior</li>
</ul>
