<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the response time of a web transaction could be misreported when making asynchronous external calls whose duration extended beyond the time the web transaction response ended.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue when using OpenRasta instrumentation where the full URL could be captured on instrumented requests. This may have resulted in query strings being collected which can contain sensitive information. See security bulletin <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr19-01">NR19-01</a>.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue with auto-instrumenting RestSharp and Couchbase driver calls involving non-public collection types.</li>
</ul>
