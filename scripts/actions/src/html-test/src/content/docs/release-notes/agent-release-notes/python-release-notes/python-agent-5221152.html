<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent updates transaction naming for <a href="https://www.starlette.io/">Starlette</a> and <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, and includes bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Improved Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Updated transaction naming for middleware in Starlette and FastAPI</strong></p>
    <p>The transaction naming hierarchy has been updated for Starlette and FastAPI applications. The web transaction name is named after the route handler, or after middleware if an exception is raised in the middleware.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>RuntimeError for imports occurring on a background thread</strong></p>
    <p>A RunTimeError was being raised in the event of imports occurring on a background thread during iteration over sys.modules. This issue has been resolved in this agent version.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fixed region aware license key default host setting</strong></p>
    <p>This agent version contains a fix for setting the default host value based on the license key for EU license keys. Setting the host manually will still override the default host value set by the license key.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
