<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A bug that could result in segfaults when transactions were restarted (either directly through <code>newrelic_start_transaction()</code> or indirectly through <code>newrelic_set_appname()</code>) was fixed.</p>
    <p>This also affected customers using Laravel Queue instrumentation, as this uses transaction restarts internally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PHPUnit may not have been detected on case sensitive filesystems on 9.0.0. This has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A bug that could result in segfaults for CodeIgniter applications on PHP 7 when <code>call_user_func_array()</code> inlining failed was fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues and workarounds</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Potential memory exhaustion for long running transactions.</strong> See description under <em>Known issues and workarounds</em> in the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-900242">PHP 9.0.0.242 release notes</a>.</li>
