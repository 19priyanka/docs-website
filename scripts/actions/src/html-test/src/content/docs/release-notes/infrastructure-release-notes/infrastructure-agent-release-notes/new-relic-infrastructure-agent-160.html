<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Containers' discovery allows you executing your integrations within a set of containers that are dynamically discovered at runtime. It also allows dynamically configuring your integrations to match the container's data (labels, ports, IPs...). Currently, Docker and Fargate containers are supported. For more information, please check the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/understand-use-data/container-auto-discovery">container auto-discovery documentation</a>.</li>
  <li>Secret variables binding allows you passing secrets (users, passwords...) to your integrations without having to write them as plain text in your configuration files. Currently, Vault and Amazon KMS are supported. For more information, please check the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/get-started/secrets-management">secrets management documentation</a>.</li>
