<h3>New in this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We are pleased to announce support for Dexguard.
    <ul>
      <li>Full build time compatibility with <em>Dexguard version 7.2.04 or higher</em></li>
      <li>Full instrumentation support</li>
      <li>De-obfuscated crash reportÂ stack traces</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The New Relic Gradle plugin depends on the Android application or library plugin having been installed first. The New Relic plugin now throws a Gradle runtime exception, which includes instructions on how to fix the problem, if it is applied before Android.</li>
  <li>Interaction trace completion was blocked on the sampling tasks running during the interaction. Any running sample tasks are stopped immediately when the interaction trace completes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>The Android agent now requires</em> <em>Proguard version 5.0 or higher for Proguard support</em></li>
</ul>
