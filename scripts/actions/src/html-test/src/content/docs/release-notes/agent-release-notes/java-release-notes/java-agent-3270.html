<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Spymemcached</p>
    <p>The Java agent now provides visibility into your applicationsâ€™ usage of Memcached when using the Spymemcached client versions 2.11 to 2.12. You will see the calls in the application breakdown, in <a href="/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details">trace details</a>, on the <a href="/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/databases-slow-queries-page">Databases page</a>, in <a href="/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/viewing-transaction-map">Transaction maps</a>, and in <a href="/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/service-maps-visualize-monitor-apps-entire-architecture">Service maps</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JDBC Drivers</p>
    <p>This release adds support for the following JDBC drivers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>INet Oracle Driver (Oranxo) 3.14</li>
      <li>Sybase (jConnect) JDBC 3 driver</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the agent treated HTTP headers as being case sensitive, causing CAT to miss under certain conditions.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where error data could be dropped, causing <code>413</code> status code errors to be reported in the agent log.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in spray-http and akka-http routing libraries where response times and/or route names could be reported incorrectly when using Futures within the route.</li>
  <li>Fixed various issues related to the proper handling of multibyte character encoding.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in Java agent version 3.26.x that could cause the Thread Profiler to time out.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where an error could get printed to the agent log when making SQL queries from an asynchronous framework.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>In support of an upcoming feature, the Java agent is now capable of reporting class metadata including class method signatures, method annotations, class annotations, field annotations, field types, and field names.</p>
<p>This reporting is on by default and can be explicitly disabled in the agent by setting the property in your <code>newrelic.yml</code> configuration file:</p>
<pre><code>command_parser:
    blacklist: send_module_metadata
</code></pre>
