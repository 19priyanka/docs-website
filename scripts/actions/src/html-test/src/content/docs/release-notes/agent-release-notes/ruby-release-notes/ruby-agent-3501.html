<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(performance) Gradual slowdown on Phusion Passenger</p>
    <p>This release resolves a performance issue that effected sites running on some versions of Phusion Passenger. The issue manifests as a slow degradation of response time and increased CPU usage. This issue was only present in version 3.5.0 of the agent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drop support for Passenger versions less than 2.1.1</p>
    <p>In order to implement the above fix we have dropped official support for Passenger versions 2.1.0 and older. These early versions of Passenger do not support an after_fork event which is necessary for the smooth operation of the agent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
