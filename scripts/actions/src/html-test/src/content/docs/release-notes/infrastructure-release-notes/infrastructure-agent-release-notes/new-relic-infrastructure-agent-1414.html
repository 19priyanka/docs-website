<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed crash behaviour while stopping the agent under certain circumstances. Ie, containerised agent service stop could trigger a crash dumping a trace.
    <ul>
      <li>Crash on stop should not be harmful for the agent itself or remaining data, but a non zero exit code and/or crash backtrace output might affect 3rd parties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
