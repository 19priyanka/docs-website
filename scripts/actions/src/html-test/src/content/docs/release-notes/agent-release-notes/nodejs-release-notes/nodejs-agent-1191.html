<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in native ES6 Promise instrumentation.</p>
    <p>Previously the Promise instrumentation would cause <code>instanceof Promise</code> to return false even if the object was a promise. This also caused an incompatibility with async-listener. <code>instanceof</code> checks will now work on both the wrapped and unwrapped Promise object.</p>
  </li>
