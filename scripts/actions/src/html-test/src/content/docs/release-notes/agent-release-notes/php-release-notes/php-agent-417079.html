<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The agent now uses the route pattern as the transaction name for unnamed, closure-based routes under Laravel. For example, the following route will now be named <strong>hello/{name}</strong> instead of <strong>GET/index.php</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Route::get('hello/{name}', function($name) { return "Hello ${name}!"; });</p>
<ul>
  <li>Previously the agent could fail to detect the Laravel framework when <code>artisan optimize</code> was used. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>When the agent cannot determine a transaction name for the Laravel framework, the name "unknown" will be used instead of "laravel-routing-error". The latter implied the cause of the failure may have originated within Laravel itself rather than solely within the agent's instrumentation.</li>
</ul>
