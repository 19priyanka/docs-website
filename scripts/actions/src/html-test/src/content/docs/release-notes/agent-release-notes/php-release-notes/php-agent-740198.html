<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>On the first request served by a PHP process, a Drupal 6 or 7 hook that was invoked with <code>module_invoke()</code> before it had been invoked by <code>module_invoke_all()</code> could have its module name reported as an empty string. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>On PHP 7.0 and 7.1, a Drupal 6 or 7 hook invoked via <code>module_invoke_all()</code> could report the module name as an empty string in some situations. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
