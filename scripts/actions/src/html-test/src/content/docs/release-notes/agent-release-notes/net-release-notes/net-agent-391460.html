<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for agent-side creation of application labels and categories via <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/net-agent-configuration#labels">newrelic.config</a> or the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable.</p>
    <p>Labeling enables organization of applications with labels and categories. The APM UI will use these labels and categories to group, filter and organize all your applications in a meaningful way; this is particularly useful if you have many applications. For more information, see <a href="/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers">Labels and categories</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes a race condition that could lead to a small amount of missing data and in some rare cases, excessive CPU utilization. Most likely to occur with WCF applications under heavy load.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where turning on high security mode and turning off SQL would result in receiving obfuscated SQL.</li>
</ul>
