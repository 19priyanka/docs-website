<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix memory leak on Python 2 WSGI applications</strong></p>
    <p>When using the 4.16.0 agent on Python 2 to monitor WSGI applications, the agent would cause memory to be allocated on each request. On Python 2, this memory was never deallocated due to a reference cycle. This has now been corrected.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
