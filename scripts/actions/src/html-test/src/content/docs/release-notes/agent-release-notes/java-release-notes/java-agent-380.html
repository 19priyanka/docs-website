<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Experimental support for Java SE 8</p>
    <p>This version includes experimental support for Java 8. Code that is known to work with Java SE 8 and compiled for Java 6 or 7 (such as Tomcat 8, Play Framework 2.3, etc) should work fine. We would like your feedback if you run into any trouble running code compiled for Java SE 8.</p>
    <p>Please only try this in non-production environments. We are eager for your feedback as we work to make Java 8 support production-ready. To enable Java SE 8 compatibility, set the following system property on your system:</p>
    <p>-Dnewrelic.enable.java.8</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for Hibernate 4.3</p>
    <p>The Java agent now reports details on calls to Hibernate 4.3 as well as previous versions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Cross-Application Tracing didn't trace when caller used WLS 11g and SOAP.</p>
    <p>In Oracle WebLogic Server 11g, cross-application tracing (CAT) failed for external calls originating in the default SOAP pipeline, producing an exception in the log. This bug has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Old DocumentationBuilderFactory can cause agent to disable itself</p>
    <p>When using a DocumentBuilderFactory implementation compiled with Java 1.4 or below an abstract method error was being thrown, causing the agent to disable itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Agent not detecting async servlets in WebSphere 8.x</p>
    <p>The Java Agent was not detecting the call to AsyncContext.complete(), so it was not reporting async servlet calls.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
