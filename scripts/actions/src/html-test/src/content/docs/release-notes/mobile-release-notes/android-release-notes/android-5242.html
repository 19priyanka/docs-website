<h3>Fixed in this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a harvest error that occurred when the sum of all activity traces exceeded the default limit (64k characters), and filtering removed all traces.</li>
  <li>Fixed a set of DEX failures that emerged when JSONObject(String) and JSONArray(String) invocations were instrumented. Unfortunately, the time spent in instance construction can no longer be reported as a result of the change.</li>
</ul>
