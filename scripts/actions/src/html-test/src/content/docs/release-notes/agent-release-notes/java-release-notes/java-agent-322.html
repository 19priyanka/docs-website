<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Play 2.2 instrumentation in action methods</p>
    <p>In version 3.2.0 and 3.2.1, the Java agent failed to instrument calls present in a controller's action method. This means database calls, external calls, and custom instrumented calls within the action method were not being reported to New Relic. This bug has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Invalid exclusive time errors with Play 2.2</p>
    <p>In version 3.2.0 and 3.2.1, the Java agent sometimes reported error messages to the newrelic log indicating an "Invalid exclusive time". This error has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Inaccurate async wait time with Play 2.x</p>
    <p>In version 3.2.0 and 3.2.1, the Java agent reported an async wait time for Play 2.x transactions that was too large. This bug has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
