<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added the <code>dns_hostname_resolution</code> configuration option (default: <code>true</code>). If set to false, the agent won't use DNS-based hostname resolution and will ask directly to the operating system.</li>
  <li>Added <code>ignore_reclaimable</code> configuration option (Linux only), which considers reclaimable memory as part of the free memory (and not part of the used memory). Free memory will be is calculated as: <code>total - free - buffers - cached - sreclaimable</code>, independently of the <code>MemAvailable</code> report from the kernel.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In cloud environments, the instance ID retrieval process is more solid during the agent startup. It also allows the agent to be spawned from VM snapshots.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Removed <code>total_cores</code> host metric.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused the <code>DiskMonitor</code> samples to show devices in the deny list (from the <code>file_devices_ignored</code> configuration option).</li>
  <li>Fixed Storage Sampler in 32-bit Windows agent.</li>
  <li>Reduced the incidence of hostname flipping in DNS-based hostname resolution.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that, in the Linux agent, removed the last character of the command line of some process samples.</li>
  <li>(Linux only) Fixed the used memory values in the System Samples, which in agent 1.2.1 were slightly different from the actual value.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem that, when an environment configuration option had a wrong format, caused the rest of the environment variables to not be parsed.</li>
</ul>
