<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent enhances our <a href="/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-mechanisms/introductory-tornado-4-support">introductory support for Tornado 4</a>, most notably by adding support for <code>tornado.curl_httpclient</code>.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tornado 4 curl_httpclient support</strong></p>
    <p>Previously, the agent's Tornado 4 instrumentation only supported the default <code>tornado.simple_httpclient</code>. With this release, support has been added for <code>tornado.curl_httpclient</code> as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tornado 4 ZeroMQ IOLoop support</strong></p>
    <p>Using <code>ZMQIOLoop</code> in place of the default Tornado <code>IOLoop</code> is now supported for Tornado 4 applications.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Improved Feature</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improved transaction names for Django REST Framework</strong></p>
    <p>When using the Python agent with Django REST Framework and Python 3, function-based views wrapped with the <code>rest_framework.decorators.api_view</code> decorator would result in transactions with names based on the decorator (<code>WrappedAPIView.handler</code>) rather than names based on the original view function. (This did not affect applications running with Python 2.)</p>
    <p>With this release, the transaction names for these wrapped views are now based on the name of the original view function in both Python 2 and Python 3.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fix</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>End transactions correctly with Tornado 4 @asynchronous decorator</strong></p>
    <p>When the agent records a transaction for a Tornado 4 <code>RequestHandler</code> method that is decorated with the <code>@tornado.web.asynchronous</code> decorator, the transaction should remain open until <code>RequestHandler.finish()</code> is called. Prior to this release, there were some circumstances where the agent closed the transaction prematurely, resulting in transaction durations that were too short. This has now been fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
