<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The Browser Agent, sometimes called the JS Agent, has multiple variants: Lite, Pro, Pro+SPA. Unless noted otherwise, all features/improvements/bug fixes are available in all variants of the agent.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Adjusted PageAction limits:</strong> Previously, we limited PageAction events to 120 per page load and only 20 events per harvest cycle, resulting in dropped data if a user sent more than 20 pageAction events in a single burst. Increasing the harvest time to 30 seconds also increases the event buffer, allowing users to send up to 60 events per harvest.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved time measurement:</strong> Previously, the agent used the system clock to calculate timing, and since the system clock may shift over the lifecycle of a page, the agent could occasionally report inaccurate or unexpectedly negative values. Going forward, the agent will use <code>perfomance.now()</code>, which is a monotonically increasing clock that starts from <code>navigationStart</code>. This change will result in more accurate timing for modern browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Preserve event listeners:</strong> Previously, if the agent doesn't load correctly it affected the functionality of <code>add-</code> and <code>removeEventListener</code>. These will now function the same whether the agent loads or not.</li>
</ul>
