<h3>Upgrade Notices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users of the <code>newrelic-php5</code> Debian package with PHP 5.2: due to discontinued support of PHP 5.2, upgrading to version 7.x of the PHP agent may result in your applications no longer reporting to New Relic. We advise that you upgrade to a supported version of PHP.</p>
    <p>If upgrading PHP is not possible, you can use <code>apt-get</code> and <code>dpkg</code> to install version 6.9 of the PHP agent and then hold that installed version by running these commands as root:</p>
    <pre><code>apt-get update
apt-get upgrade newrelic-php5-common=6.9.0.182 newrelic-daemon=6.9.0.182 newrelic-php5=6.9.0.182
echo 'newrelic-php5-common hold' | dpkg --set-selections
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic transaction naming has been fixed for <a href="http://symfony.com/legacy">Symfony 1</a> users who <a href="https://symfony.com/legacy/doc/reference/1_4/en/05-Factories#chapter_05_controller">replaced the controller class via <code>factories.yml</code></a> with one that did not call <code>sfFrontWebController::dispatch()</code> or <code>sfController::forward()</code>.</li>
  <li>Datastore metrics could not be generated for <a href="https://github.com/nrk/predis">Predis</a> 0.7 and 0.8 in version 7.1 of the PHP agent. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>The agent would not report <a href="https://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.http.client.html"><code>Zend_Http_Client</code></a> external calls when the Zend Framework was used directly as a library or indirectly by a framework like Symfony or Magento. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
