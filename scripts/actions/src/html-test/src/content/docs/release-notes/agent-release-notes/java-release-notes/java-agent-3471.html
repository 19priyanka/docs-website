</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<h4>Fixes in 3.48.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue that in rare cases prevented Play async transaction tracking</li>
  <li>Fixes a memory leak that could occur in Spymemcached instrumentation</li>
  <li>Fix to disable attributes.include lists when High Security Mode is enabled</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where errors outside of a transaction did not contain custom attributes on the event</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue that caused the UI to not display errors that had error messages over 255 bytes</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.0.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the Thread Profiler could fail to report. In this case, the agent logged a java.lang.StackOverflowError</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.1.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure that custom events added during a transaction do not get discarded if the transaction is ignored via a call to NewRelic.ignoreTransaction().</li>
  <li>A security update that corrects an issue affecting PostgreSQL that could occur if High Security Mode was enabled (or record_sql was set to off) and a query ran slow enough to trigger an explain plan. If the above conditions were met the agent may not have properly stripped out all information from the query. For information on this fix, see the security bulletin.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the agent could not parse database statements that included the IGNORE and INTO keywords.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.2.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes a bug where transactions were being kept alive for too long when application is under heavy GC, causing inaccurate throughput to be reported.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug in which Akka routing instrumentation could cause extra memory usage. When this is the case, the transaction throughput will look significantly lower than anticipated.</li>
  <li>Fixes a rare bug in Play WS instrumentation where exceptions thrown by instrumentation were propagated out to the application code, potentially causing the request to error.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where Jersey Client and HttpUrlConnection could be double instrumented, resulting in inflated external call count.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where the total time and response time for a long running task could be misreported.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.3.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue where transaction throughput counts could be artificially inflated when using async servlets in Jersey.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where JBoss and Wildfly datasources could cause a LinkageError.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.4.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the Java agent 4.3.0 would not report data depending on the locale setting of the JVM. Java Agent 4.3.0 failed to send event data if the JVM locale is set to use a comma as the decimal. You would see NumberFormatException in the agent log.</li>
  <li>Fixes a rare issue where the agent will incorrectly attempt to continually retransform classes when an extension with a modification date in the future is used, causing a significant increase in CPU load.</li>
  <li>Fixes a ConcurrentModificationException caused by ning instrumentation that manifests in Mule instrumentation that causes the request it affects to be retried and the Java agent to not report header data.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where if enable_auto_app_naming was set to true and distributed_tracing.enabled was set to true it would sample every distributed trace event. Now if the agent has both configs enabled, it will not turn on distributed tracing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.5.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue where OKHttp 3 was not tracking external total time correctly.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where for some JDBC drivers, the agent would execute additional getMetaData queries..</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue with the agent’s Scala instrumentation that could result in incorrect throughput, invalid or negative data in transaction segments, or inability to ignore status codes.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue with the play-ws instrumentation that caused ClassNotFound exceptions to occur in the agent logs when withHeaders is used. This could result incomplete transactions and attributes in RPM.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.6.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the agent could cause an application deadlock when two tokens are created and linked from the other’s thread. This affects users of the New Relic token API and also users of the Hystrix framework.</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the agent would not capture JMX Datasource information from Tomcat when JDNI GlobalNamingResources is used.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.7.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>None</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.8.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the agent would break webpage rendering by inserting New Relic Browser monitoring javascript into the <code>&#x3C;header></code> tag of pages which were missing <code>&#x3C;head></code> tags.</li>
  <li>Certain frameworks, like Spring Cloud Gateway, triggered a bug in the Spring webflux instrumentation, causing transactions to stay open until they timed out. This bug resulted in more memory pressure and looked like a memory leak. This has been fixed in this release.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the agent would stop reporting to New Relic following a ForceDisconnectException and accumulate transaction data resulting in OutOfMemory Exceptions.</li>
  <li>The agent now validates that app_names only contains three application names. If the agent is configured to report more than three application names, the agent will log a warning message and stop reporting to New Relic.</li>
  <li>When a custom WSRequestFilter is used that modifies an outbound play-ws request, the agent would report overly long segments due to Segment timeouts and will also result in a loss of External/ metrics. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.9.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes a possible NullPointerException that could occur in Hystrix instrumentation and propagate into application code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes a bug where usage of the HttpsURLConnection getInputStream() method could cause some scoped external metrics to be double-counted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes an issue that prevents the agent from connecting to an HTTP proxy that does not requires a username or password.</p>
    <p>When configured to use an HTTP proxy by using proxy_host and proxy_port, the agent would look for proxy_username and proxy_password. If those weren't provided, the agent would use an empty string for proxy_username and proxy_password.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prevents unnecessary dependencies from showing up in the newrelic-agent pom</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes deadlocks occurring in agent 4.7.0 that were caused by instrumentation of classes in the sun/nio/cs/.* package</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes an issue where custom jmx metrics with '.'s in the attribute name would not get recorded.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.11.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue where applications using neo4j bolt JDBC driver could fail to start.</li>
  <li>"log_daily" configuration did not respect documented precedence</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug that caused the Spring Webflux instrumentation to fail to apply for spring-webflux versions greater than 5.0.*</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where transactions would not be fully reported if distributed_tracing.enabled = true and cross_application_tracer.enabled = false</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where Akka Http application would not start with the agent attached when using sbt</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where the agent could fail to determine the Hostname</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.12.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue with Jax-RS subresource transaction naming where the root path is duplicated when a nested resource structure is used. This could lead to transactions being named incorrectly for incoming requests to a Jax-RS framework.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the agent's Jetty metric sampling that could prevent Jetty specific metrics from being reported when the number of threads returned by JMX is zero.</li>
  <li>Fixed a NullPointerException that can occur when Cross Application Tracing configuration is explicitly disabled.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where transactions would be named incorrectly when using custom Akka Http stream directives or a pathEnd directive followed by a Segment directive.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where certain usages of Akka and Scala would prevent transactions from being reported to New Relic. This would also manifest as a NullPointerException in the agent log at <code>finest</code> level.</li>
  <li>The Java agent no longer includes Jaxb or Logback dependencies. A new dependency on Log4j2 has been added</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes in 4.12.1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue where an exception would be thrown during agent initialization which caused the application to shut down when the log file is not writable. In previous agent versions there was an undocumented behavior where the agent would log to STDOUT instead.</li>
  <li>Fixed a regression where a NullPointerException would be logged and instrumentation would not be applied when using an XML extension with comments preceding the instrumentation section.</li>
  <li>Fixed issue where setting the <code>log_limit_in_kbytes</code> greater than 0 and <code>log_file_count</code> equal to 1 would result in the agent not logging to the agent log file.</li>
</ul>
