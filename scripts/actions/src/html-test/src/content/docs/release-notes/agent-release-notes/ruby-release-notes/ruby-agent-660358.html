<h2>v6.6.0</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bugfix for ActionCable Instrumentation</strong></p>
    <p>Previous versions of the agent sometimes caused application crashes with some versions of ActionCable. The application would exit quickly after startup with the error: <code>uninitialized constant ActionCable::Engine</code>.</p>
    <p>Version 6.6.0 of the agent no longer crashes in this way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Handling of disabling Error Collection</strong></p>
    <p>When the agent first starts, it begins collecting Error Events and Traces before fetching configuration from New Relic. In previous versions of the agent, those events or traces would be sent to New Relic, even if <strong>Error Collection</strong> is disabled in the application's server-side configuration.</p>
    <p>Version 6.6.0 of the agent drops all collected Error Events and Traces if the configuration from the server disables <strong>Error Collection</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
