<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Metrics may be reported with an incorrect throughput after communication failure with New Relic</strong></p>
    <p>For agent versions 5.2.0 through 5.4.0, metric throughput may have been reported inaccurately after experiencing network / communication failures with New Relic. The throughput reported for all metrics after this failure may have been abnormally high.</p>
