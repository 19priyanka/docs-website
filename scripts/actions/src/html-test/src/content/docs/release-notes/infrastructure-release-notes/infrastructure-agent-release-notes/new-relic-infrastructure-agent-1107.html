<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All the distributions of the Agent (packages, containers...) are shipped with <code>nri-flex</code> and <code>nri-docker</code> integrations, so you don't need to install them anymore.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Agent <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure">Linux package</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/infrastructure">containerized agent</a> both now include <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/nri-docker/">nri-docker</a>. Before, only the package did.</li>
      <li>Agent <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure">Linux package</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/infrastructure">containerized agent</a> both now include <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/">nri-flex</a>. Before, none did.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New containerized agent "bundle" was created from <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-bundle">https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-bundle</a> , and published at (DockerHub)[<a href="https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-bundle%5D">https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-bundle]</a>. "Bundle" container can now be released and included agent and integration versions could be tracked from the GH repository <em>tags</em> and <code>versions</code> file.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>Auto-discovery annotations</em> no longer override <em>integration metrics</em>.
    <ul>
      <li>For example: it avoids <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/link-apps-services/monitor-services-running-kubernetes">Kubernetes auto-discovery</a> overriding the cluster_name attributes if it's already set in the integration configuration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Removed a memory leak that caused a slow but constant increase in memory and CPU consumption (up to 1%cpu &#x26; 5MB per week).</li>
</ul>
