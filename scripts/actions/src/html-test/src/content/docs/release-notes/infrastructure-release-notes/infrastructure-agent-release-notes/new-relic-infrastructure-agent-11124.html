<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Agent version is now logged in non-verbose mode, too.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A missing parsers configuration file for the log forwarder has been restored to the Windows installer.</li>
  <li>The <code>mountInfo</code> / <code>diskstats</code> mapping for fetching LVM volumes' I/O stats has been fixed; it can still fail for older systems that lack a <code>mountInfo</code> file and use custom names for their LVM volumes.</li>
  <li>A bug in the log forwarder that prevented some <code>tcp</code> and <code>syslog</code> URIs to be parsed correctly has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The built-in Flex integration has been updated to version 1.1.2. For more information, <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">see the Flex changelog</a>.</li>
  <li>The built-in Docker integration has been updated to version 1.2.1. For more information, <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/nri-docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">see the Docker integration changelog</a>.</li>
