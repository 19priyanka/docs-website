<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>shutdown</code> method is now on the stub API.</p>
    <p>Previously when the agent was disabled the stub API passed back on require did not have the <code>shutdown</code> method. Thanks goes to Vlad Fedosov (@StyleT) for this contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global timers will now be wrapped correctly regardless of being wrapped by something else.</p>
    <p>The logic to check whether to wrap the <code>global</code> timers was looking to see if the <code>global</code> timers were the same function reference as the ones in the <code>timers</code> module. This would break in cases where either the <code>global</code> or <code>timers</code> functions had been wrapped.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Director instrumentation now correctly handles the case of null route handlers being passed in.</p>
    <p>Previously the agent's director instrumentation would crash in cases of null route handlers in director.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
