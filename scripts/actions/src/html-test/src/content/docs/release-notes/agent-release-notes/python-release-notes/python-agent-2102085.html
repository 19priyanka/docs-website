<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent contains improvements to the time tracing API as well as bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Time Trace API Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Time trace APIs (such as function_trace) can now be used with coroutines</strong></p>
    <p>The following decorator APIs can now be used with native coroutines and generators:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>function_trace</li>
      <li>database_trace</li>
      <li>datastore_trace</li>
      <li>external_trace</li>
      <li>message_trace</li>
      <li>memcache_trace</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre><code>@function_trace(name='my_coroutine')
async def my_coroutine():
  await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>gRPC instrumentation used on Python 2.x can cause a memory leak</strong></p>
    <p>When using gRPC on Python 2, gRPC futures would not be garbage collected resulting in a memory leak. gRPC futures will now be garbage collected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Instrumentation for Dropbox v8.0 and newer caused error log messages</strong></p>
    <p>Dropbox client version 8.0 or higher raised instrumentation errors. These errors did not prevent metrics on Dropbox from being sent. These errors have been removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Values from negated ranges were sometimes added to ignore_status_codes</strong></p>
    <p>Negated status codes not found in the current ignore_status_codes were added if they were part of a range of values. This issue has been addressed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
