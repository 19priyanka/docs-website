<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rails 5 support</p>
    <p>This release includes experimental support for Rails 5 as of 5.0.0.beta2. Please note that this release does not include any support for ActionCable, the WebSockets framework new to Rails 5.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don't include extension from single format GrapeÂ API transaction names</p>
    <p>Starting with Grape 0.12.0, an API with a single format no longer declares methods with <code>.:format</code>, but with an extension such as <code>.json</code>. Thanks Daniel Doubrovkine for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix warnings about shadowing outer local variable when running tests</p>
    <p>Thanks Rafael Almeida de Carvalho for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check config first for Rails middleware instrumentation installation</p>
    <p>Checking the config first avoids issues with mock classes that don't implement <code>VERSION</code>. Thanks Jesse Sanford for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove a trailing whitespace in the template for generated newrelic.yml</p>
    <p>Thanks Paul Menzel for the contribution!</p>

  <li>
    <p>Reference external resources in comments and readme with HTTPS</p>
