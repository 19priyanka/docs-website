<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>gRPC</p>
    <p>The Java agent now has support for gRPC version 1.22</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dragonwell JDK</p>
    <p>The Java agent now fully supports Alibaba's Dragonwell JDK</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Azul Zing</p>
    <p>The Java agent now supports Azul's Zing JVM</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enables ability to migrate to <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/enable-configurable-security-policies">Configurable Security Policies (CSP)</a> on a per agent basis for accounts already using <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/high-security-mode">High Security Mode (HSM</a>.</p>
    <p>When both HSM and CSP are enabled for an account, an agent (this version or later) can successfully connect with either high_security: true or the appropriate security_policies_token configured.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>LinkageError for applications using both OpenJ9 and Log4J log manager</li>
  <li>ClassNotFoundException for applications that specify a Log4j ContextSelector via the -DLog4jContextSelector system property</li>
  <li>Akka-http instrumentation would name transactions incorrectly when using an asynchronous onComplete callback to match routes</li>
  <li>The agentâ€™s JaxRS instrumentation did not apply to cases where a concrete class implements the same method from two different interfaces</li>
  <li>The agent would not report JMX metrics when one or more composite attributes were null</li>
  <li>Race condition that could throw a NullPointerException in the agent log during class transformation</li>
  <li>Akka-http path matching instrumentation could produce NullPointerExceptions when using a "repeat" path segment with no values. Transactions that pass some values will report as-is, but transactions that pass no values will be reported with a different segment in the metric name: "().repeat()"</li>
  <li>ignore_status_codes system property was not getting applied correctly</li>
</ul>
