<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
<p>This release is a bug-fix release only and adds no new features to the agent. The following bugs introduced in 3.0/3.1 have been fixed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed two segmentation violations that would occur after calling the <code>newrelic_set_appname()</code> API call. One had the potential to affect all users, the other was restricted to customers who used prepared SQL statements both before and after the call to <code>newrelic_set_appname()</code>.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem with the Solaris init scripts which made the incorrect assumption about the process ID of init.</li>
  <li>Fixed a small memory leak that affected CodeIgniter, CakePHP and Drupal applications.</li>
</ul>
