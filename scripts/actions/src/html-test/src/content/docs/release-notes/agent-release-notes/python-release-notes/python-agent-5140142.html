<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent includes improvements to distributed tracing, and bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add new span attribute transaction.name</strong></p>
    <p>A new attribute, <code>transaction.name</code>, has been added to the root span.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Improved features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Transaction attributes are added to the root span</strong></p>
    <p>Transaction attributes, including response attributes, are now added to the root span.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Custom attributes are added to the root span</strong></p>
    <p>The public API methods <code>newrelic.agent.add_custom_param</code> and <code>newrelic.agent.add_custom_params</code> now add the specified custom attribute to the root span in addition to the transaction. If the maximum number of custom attributes is reached, span-level custom attributes take precedence over transaction-level custom attributes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Error attributes added to each span/segment</strong></p>
    <p>Error attributes <code>error.class</code> and <code>error.message</code> to all spans that exit without handling an exception.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>asyncio: application crash when a transaction that started on a completed parent task exits</strong></p>
    <p>When a transaction that started on a completed parent task exited, an exception was raised. This error has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Error attributes are no longer added if the error collector is disabled</strong></p>
    <p>If the error collector is disabled via error_collector.enabled, error attributes <code>error.class</code> and <code>error.message</code> are not added to the currently executing span.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Updates</h2>
<p>Note that changes were made that add attributes to the root span. Transaction-level attribute filtering via the transaction.attribute.exclude configuration setting will not filter the attribute(s) for the root span. Those attributes may unexpectedly start to appear on the root span.</p>
