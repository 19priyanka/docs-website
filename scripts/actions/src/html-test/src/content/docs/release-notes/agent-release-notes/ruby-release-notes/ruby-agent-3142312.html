<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Improved transaction names for Sinatra</p>
    <p>The agent will now use <code>sinatra.route</code> for transaction names on Sinatra 1.4.3+, which sets it in the request environment. This gives names that closer resemble the routes defined in the Sinatra DSL. Thanks to Brian Phillips for the suggestion!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for error flag on transaction events</p>
    <p>There was an issue causing the error flag to always be set to false for Insights transaction events that has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Official support for Sidekiq 4</p>
    <p>The Ruby agent now officially supports Sidekiq 4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional attributes collected</p>
    <p>The agent now collects the following information in web transactions: <code>Content-Length</code> HTTP response and <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP request headers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
