<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>New Relic Infrastructure Agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">Update the Infrastructure agent</a> for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.</p>
<p>Note also that this is a Windows and Linux release.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce log noise for short lived processes and built-in modules that are not active on the current platform.</li>
  <li>Agent can be run with empty config files or no config file at all (when using environment variables for necessary configuration options like your license key).</li>
  <li>Adds configuration option <code>log_to_stdout</code> (default is true). Set this option to <code>false</code> to restrict log output to a file only when <code>log_file</code> is configured.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fix so no extra command line elements are added when creating an On-Host Integration with no parameters using Python.</li>
</ul>
