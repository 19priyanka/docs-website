<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don't use a pager when running <code>git log</code> command</p>
    <p>This would cause Capistrano deploys to hang when a large number of commits were being deployed. Thanks to John Naegle for reporting and fixing this issue!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Official support for JRuby 9.0.0.0</p>
    <p>The Ruby agent is now officially fully tested and supported on JRuby 9.0.0.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instrumentation for MongoDB 2.1.x</p>
    <p>Visibility in your MongoDB queries returns when using version 2.1.0 of the Mongo driver or newer. Thanks to Durran Jordan of MongoDB for contributing the Mongo Monitoring instrumentation!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix for ArgumentError "invalid byte sequence in UTF-8"</p>
    <p>This would come up when trying to parse out the operation from a database query containing characters that would trigger a invalid byte sequence in UTF-8 error. Thanks to Mario Izquierdo for reporting this issue!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved database metric names for ActiveRecord::Calculations queries</p>
    <p>Aggregate metrics recorded for queries made via the ActiveRecord::Calculations module (#count, #sum, #max, etc.) will now be associated with the correct model name, rather than being counted as generic 'select' operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allow at_exit handlers to be installed for Rubinius</p>
    <p>Rubinius can support the at_exit block used by install_exit_handler. Thanks to Aidan Coyle for reporting and fixing this issue!</p>
