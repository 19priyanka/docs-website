<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Allow agent to use alternate certificate stores</p>
    <p>When connecting via SSL to New Relic, the Ruby agent verifies its connection via a certificate bundle shipped with the agent. This caused problems with certain proxy configurations, so the <code>ca_bundle_path</code> setting in newrelic.yml can now override the default cert bundle location.</p>
    <p>For more information, see <a href="/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-configuration/ssl-settings-ruby-agent">custom SSL certificates</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rails 4.2 beta in tests</p>
    <p>Although still in beta, a new version of Rails is on its way! We're already running our automated test suites against the beta to ensure New Relic is ready the day the next Rails is released.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ActiveRecord 4 cached queries fix</p>
    <p>Queries against the ActiveRecord 4.x query cache were incorrectly being counted as database time by the agent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix for error in newrelic.yml loading</p>
    <p>If your application used a <code>RAILS_ENV</code> value that was not listed in newrelic.yml recent agent versions would return a NameError rather than a helpful message. This has been fixed. Thanks Oleksiy Kovyrin for the patch!</p>
