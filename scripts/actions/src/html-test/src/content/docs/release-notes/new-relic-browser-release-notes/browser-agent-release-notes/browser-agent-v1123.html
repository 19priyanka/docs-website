<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fixed issue with capturing AJAX status code in Angular apps:</strong> Angular calls abort() on the XHR object after it successfully finishes. This was seen by our instrumentation as a call that did not finish, and as a result status code was set to <code>0</code> and reported as a network error. This fix addresses this use case by capturing status code before the call is aborted.</li>
</ul>
