<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We're excited to announce the addition of a new Node VMs page to the UI that provides a curated view of the cpu, memory, garbage collection, and event loop metrics that we have added over the past several releases of the node agent and native-metrics module.</p>
    <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/node-vms-statistics-page">our documentation.</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added instrumentation of When.js promise library.</p>
    <p>Previously, the transaction state could get lost when multiple promises resolved close to each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed name of environment variable in error message when configuration file cannot be found. Thanks to @Maubic for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Updated tests to work with the latest version of Node 7.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
