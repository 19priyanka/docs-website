<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>As enterprises adopt more scalable microservice architectures, it becomes more difficult to pinpoint performance issues within the application stack. New Relicâ€™s new health map feature brings together insights on application and infrastructure performance into a single, prioritized view. This unified view enables operations and DevOps teams to quickly understand if the source of a performance issue is from the application code or in the infrastructure layer.</p>
