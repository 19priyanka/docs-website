<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rewrote the <code>cassandra-cql</code> and <code>memcached</code> instrumentations using the <code>DatastoreShim</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved instrumentation matching.</p>
    <p>Previously, the agent would determine which instrumentation would run for a given module being loaded using the basename of the file path. This lead to false positives (e.g. <code>myapp/lib/express.js</code> would trigger the express instrumentation) which we previously just ignored. Matches are now determined using the string passed to <code>require</code>. This means you can now match local relative paths (<code>./lib/something</code>) as well as package-relative paths (<code>amqplib/callback_api</code>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
