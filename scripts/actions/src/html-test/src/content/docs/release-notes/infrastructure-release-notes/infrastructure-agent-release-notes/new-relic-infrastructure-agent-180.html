<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>New <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180">integrations engine</a>, which coexists with the previous engine for backwards-compatibility and smoother transition. Featuring:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simpler setup of integrations, with fewer files and fewer mandatory properties. In some cases, you only have to set the integration name to enable it.</li>
  <li>Flexible configuration of integrations via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files.</li>
  <li>Ability to group different integrations in the same configuration file.</li>
  <li>Hot reload of integrations, so you can add a new integration or change its configuration without needing to restart the Infrastructure agent.</li>
  <li>Timeouts when an integration does not respond before a user-specified time. The integration process is killed and restarted. This can also be disabled.</li>
  <li>Smooth migration from the old integrations engine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read the documentation about <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180">Infrastructure integration configuration file specifications for agent v1.8.0 or higher</a> for a complete description of how to start using the new integrations engine, as well as a detailed description and examples of the new configuration options.</p>
