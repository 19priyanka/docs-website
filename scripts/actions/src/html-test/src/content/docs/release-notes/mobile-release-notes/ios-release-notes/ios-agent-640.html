<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>+setMaxEventBufferTime</code> and <code>+setMaxEventPoolSize</code> now persist between background/foreground</li>
  <li>dSYM upload script has been improved. It is now better at finding and uploading dSYMs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reduced agent size by removing old architectures. Note: with the removal of i386 the agent will no longer build with iPhone4S simulators (however, it will still run on iPhone4S devices.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: This agent was built with Xcode10. It may be necessary to use Xcode10 for compatibility.</p>
