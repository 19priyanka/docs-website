<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inventory body reporting the agent entity ID.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Supporting Overlay File Systems in the storage samples. Before agent 1.8.23, a device mapped from multiple overlay folders might not be reported as the parent partition but as any folder mounting it. Now the agent reports the parent mount folder.</li>
  <li>Removed confusing warning log message from the integrations' engine ignoring legacy configuration files.</li>
</ul>
