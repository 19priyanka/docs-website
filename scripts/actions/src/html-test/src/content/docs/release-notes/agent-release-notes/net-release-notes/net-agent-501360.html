<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes a bug where self-hosted WCF applications would not correctly report on the overview page.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where database calls and external calls in a background/async thread would result in a transaction named <code>*</code> showing up in the Other bucket.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where apdex was not reported for self-hosted WCF applications.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where API calls from an application that didn't have any instrumentation would not report any data.</li>
  <li>SQL object names are more accurately parsed. In particular, table names will be recognized with an expanded set of characters. The agent is able to parse table names with a variety of separator characters and formatting whitespace. For example, <code>{Table1}</code>, <code>[ Table2 ]</code>, <code>"Table3"</code> and <code>Table4</code>.</li>
