<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>New Relic Infrastructure agent builds are available for multiple platforms. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">Update the Infrastructure agent</a> for how to download and update the appropriate version of the agent for your platform.</p>
<p>Note also that this is a Linux and Windows release.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Allow disabling inventory of SELinux modules in hosts where the associated command consumes too much CPU. Set <code>selinux_enable_semodule</code> configuration option to <code>false</code> to disable it while keeping the rest of SELinux plugin features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug that avoided updating the information of a Linux process when its command name changes at runtime, or when a new process starts with a PID that already existed for a previous process.</li>
</ul>
