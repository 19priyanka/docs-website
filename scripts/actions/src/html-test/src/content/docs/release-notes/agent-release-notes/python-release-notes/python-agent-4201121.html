<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent includes bug fixes, deprecations, and improved naming behavior for gRPC.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Feature Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improved gRPC support</strong></p>
    <p>The external and transaction pages now show the gRPC method being called in addition to the host and port.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ability to disable sending db.statement as part of traces</strong></p>
    <p>When db.statement is added to either attributes.exclude or transaction_segments.attributes.exclude, the value will now no longer be sent to New Relic as part of transaction traces or spans.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TransactionContext API is now deprecated</strong></p>
    <p>The TransactionContext API will be removed in a future release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tornado instrumentation + feature flag deprecation</strong></p>
    <p>The existing introductory support for Tornado and feature flags will be removed from a future release. Versions 6.x and newer will be the only versions of Tornado supported in future releases. See <a href="https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/python-tornado-support/75613">this discussion</a> on the New Relic forums for more details.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fixed a crash when using uvicorn workers with gunicorn</strong></p>
    <p>When running ASGI applications with gunicorn, the agent would attempt to instrument the application as a WSGI application, resulting in a crash. The agent will no longer attempt to instrument gunicorn applications that are coroutines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Remove logging of license keys</strong></p>
    <p>The agent logged license keys when data failed to send to New Relic. The agent will no longer log license keys to the agent logs under any circumstance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix operation of distributed tracing and cross application tracing when httplib connections are reused</strong></p>
    <p>When making multiple requests via a single connection with httplib, httplib2, or urllib3, the proper headers will be added to each outgoing request. As a result, cross application tracing and distributed tracing will now operate as expected when reusing connection objects.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
