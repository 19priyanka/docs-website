<h2>v5.2.0</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use priority sampling for errors and custom events</p>
    <p>Priority sampling replaces the older reservoir event sampling method. With this change, the agent will maintain randomness across a given time period while improving coordination among transactions, errors, and custom events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for wrapping datastore operations</p>
    <p>The agent will now complete the process of wrapping datastore operations even if an error occurs during execution of a callback.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
