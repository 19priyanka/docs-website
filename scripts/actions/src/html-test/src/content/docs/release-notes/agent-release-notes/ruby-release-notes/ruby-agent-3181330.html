    <p>Ensure Mongo aggregate queries are properly obfuscated</p>
    <p>Instrumentation for the Mongo 2.x driver had a bug where the <code>pipeline</code> attribute of Mongo aggregate queries was not properly obfuscated. Users who have sensitive data in their <code>aggregate</code> queries are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this version of the agent. Users who are unable to upgrade are encouraged to turn off query collection using by setting <code>mongo.capture_queries</code> to false in their newrelic.yml files.</p>
    <p>This release fixes <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr17-03">New Relic Security Bulletin NR17-03</a>.</p>
