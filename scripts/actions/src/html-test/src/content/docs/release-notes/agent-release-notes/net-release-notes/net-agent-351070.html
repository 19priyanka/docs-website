<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This release enhances cross application tracing with a visualization of the cross application calls that a specific Transaction Trace is involved in. The new visualization helps you spot bottlenecks in external services within Transaction Traces and gives you an end-to-end understanding of how the transaction trace is used by other applications and services. This leads to faster problem diagnosis and better collaboration across teams. All agents involved in the cross application communication must be upgraded to see the complete graph. You can view cross application traces from in the Transaction Trace drill-down.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes a problem where a transaction may not be correctly recorded if the application is using WCF services. In this case, one of two exception types may appear in the agent log file: a Null Reference Exception or an Object Disposed Exception.</li>
</ul>
