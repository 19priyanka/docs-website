<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Support for New Relic Synthetics</p>
    <p>The Ruby agent now gives you additional information for requests from New Relic Synthetics. More transaction traces and events give you a clearer look into how your application is performing around the world.</p>
    <p>For more details, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/new-relic-synthetics">https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-s...</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for multiple job per fork gems with Resque</p>
    <p>The resque-jobs-per-fork and resque-multi-job-forks gems alter Resque to fork every N jobs instead of every job. This previously caused issues for the Ruby agent, but those have been resolved. These gems are fully supported.</p>
    <p>Running Resque with the FORK_PER_JOB=false environment variable setting is also supported now.</p>
    <p>For more details on our Resque support, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/background-jobs/resque-instrumentation">https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/background-jobs/resque-...</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Support agent when starting Resque Pool from Rake task</p>
    <p>When running resque-pool with its provided rake tasks, the agent would not start up properly. Thanks Tiago Sousa for the fix!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix for DelayedJob + Rails 4.x queue depth metrics</p>
    <p>The Ruby agent periodically records DelayedJob queuedepth as a metric, but this didn't work properly in Rails 4.x applications. This has been fixed. Thanks Jonathan del Strother for his help with the issue!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix for failure in background transactions with rules.ignore_url_regexes</p>
    <p>The recently added feature for ignoring transactions via URL regexes caused errors for non-web transactions. This has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rename the TransactionNamer.name method to TransactionNamer.name_for</p>
    <p>The internal TransactionNamer class had a class method called 'name', with a different signature than the existing Class#name method and could cause problems when trying to introspect instances of the class.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Dennis Taylor for contributing this fix!</p>
