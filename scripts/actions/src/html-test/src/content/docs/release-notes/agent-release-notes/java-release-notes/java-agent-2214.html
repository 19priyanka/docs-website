<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Metric Grouping Issue with Netty</p>
    <p>The request URL was referenced in some metric names, causing Metric Explosion. The URL is no longer included in the metric name.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Make Cookie parsing more robust when running on Netty</p>
    <p>Cases where the Cookie header was malformed were causing exceptions to be thrown. Agent now makes a better effort to capture the individual valid parts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Agent could not connect to New Relic in non-DNS environments</p>
    <p>Fixed an issue which caused the agent to only be able to connect to New Relic in environments where DNS was used for hostname resolution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: In 2.21.2 and 2.21.3 an @Trace annotation ignored the transaction for Apdex</p>
    <p>An @Trace annotation on a method called in a web transaction had the side-effect of ignoring the transaction for calculating the Apdex score.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
