<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed duplicated external transactions for <code>https</code> requests in Node > 0.10.</p>
    <p>Any external transaction that used the <code>https</code> module to make the request would appear twice in transaction traces due to <code>https.request</code> internally using <code>http.request</code>. This has now been resolved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Updated eslint dev dependency to 2.9.0 (was 0.24.1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed an issue with transaction naming precedence.</p>
    <p>Custom naming of transactions will no longer be replaced by names generated by the instrumentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed tests which broke under Node 6.0.</p>
    <p>Node 6.0.0 changed some messaging and internal functionality which our tests were asserting on. These tests have been updated to work with either the new version or the older ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed installing GCC 5 in Travis for testing native modules in Node >= 3.0.</p>
    <p>Starting in Node 3.0, native modules were compiled with C++11 features enabled. The version of GCC preinstalled on Travis was too old to support that so we now manually install GCC 5 and set it as the system compiler.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed metrics that were being scoped to themselves.</p>
    <p>Some metrics were scoped to themselves, causing a strange visual glitch in the New Relic UI. This self-scoping has been removed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added tests for transaction naming with parallel requests in Express.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
