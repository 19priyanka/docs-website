<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in environment variable based configuration.</p>
    <p>Previously the agent would parse the <code>NEW_RELIC_APDEX</code> environment variable as a string rather than a float this could cause data to be sent to New Relic servers in an invalid format, preventing the data from being collected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug with the error collector's handling of ignored status codes.</p>
    <p>Previously the agent would not properly ignore status codes if the status code was set using a string rather than a number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in mysql instrumentation.</p>
    <p>Previously the mysql instrumentation could cause errors when making mysql queries using an options object rather than a SQL string. The agent now handles arguments to the query method in a more robust way.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
