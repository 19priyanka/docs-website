<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Now the Infrastructure agent, when running on Linux, can collect <a href="/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/docker-installation/docker-container-monitoring-infrastructure">Docker container metrics</a> like CPU, memory, I/O and network. This feature is enabled by default for all <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems">supported Linux OSs</a>. Please, ensure the host meets the <a href="/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/docker-installation/docker-container-monitoring-infrastructure#requirements">requirements</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180">new integration config files</a> now support the <code>when</code> section. It allows you to control the execution of an integration if a given file exists. Here's an example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>integrations:
  - name: ssh-integration
    when:
      file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid
</code></pre>
<p>The agent will execute <code>ssh-integration</code> only if the <code>/var/run/sshd.pid</code> file exists.</p>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Agent service wasn't stopping / restarting properly on upstart-based Linux distributions.</li>
  <li>In Integration config files: Dollar symbols were unintentionally being expanded into environment variables. Before, <code>pa$$word</code> would have been expanded to <code>pa${}${}word</code>; this behavior has been corrected.</li>
  <li>Improved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System">NFS</a> support. Read and write bytes per second were not being correctly set to <code>0</code>, resulting JSON marshalling errors.</li>
</ul>
