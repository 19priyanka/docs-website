<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reduce agent CPU overhead by omitting <code>setImmediate</code> from traces.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The change to <code>setImmediate</code> makes that function behave the same way as <code>nextTick</code> and other frequently-called functions that are already elided from Transaction Traces.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mitigate a Node.js memory leak that can occur during TLS connections.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>There is an outstanding Node.js Core memory leak involving TLS connections. Clients specifying certificates, such as the New Relic Agent, quickly reveal this leak. We now mitigate this issue by using the default client certificates where possible. A new log message will be printed when the TLS memory leak workaround can not be used, such as when using a custom certificate with an HTTPS proxy.</p>
