<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Support for mixed Laravel 4 and 5 environments has been improved.</p>
    <p>Web servers serving both Laravel 4 and Laravel 5 applications from the same process pool could see autoloader errors in the Laravel 4 applications after the first load of a Laravel 5 page. This has been fixed, and mixed environments should now work as expected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Laravel detection has been improved.</p>
    <p>Starting with Laravel 5.0.15, applications with an optimized classloader use a new location for the optimized "compiled.php" file. Previously, the agent would fail to detect Laravel in this circumstance. The agent now looks in this new location as well as the old location for Laravel auto-detection.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
