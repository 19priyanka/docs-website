<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improved <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery">auto discovery</a> of ports:
    <ul>
      <li>If a container exposes ports 80 and 443, then <code>${discovery.port}</code> or <code>${discovery.ports.0}</code> would equal to port <code>80</code> and <code>${discovery.ports.1}</code> to <code>443</code>. As ports are are sorted in ascending order, port <code>8080</code> would have been assigned to number three and so on.</li>
      <li>Ports are also tagged by port type (usually TCP): <code>${discovery.ports.tcp}</code> and <code>${discovery.ports.tcp.0}</code> would equal to <code>80</code> and <code>${discovery.ports.tcp.1}</code> to <code>443</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>On Windows, the agent can now report processes even when their command line cannot be gathered. The <a href="/attribute-dictionary/processsample/commandline">commandLine</a> attribute will be empty in those cases.</li>
</ul>
