<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do not run explain plans for psycopg2 connections using the <code>async_</code> kwarg</strong></p>
    <p>As "async" is now a keyword in Python 3.7, psycopg2 now allows "async_" as an alias for its "async" kwarg for psycopg2.connect as of psycopg2 v2.7.4. Previously, explain plans were attempted for these connections and a traceback would be seen in the logs. This has now been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix traceback when using callbacks as partials in pika consumers</strong></p>
    <p>When passing a callback that is a functools partial to pika channel consumers, a traceback occurred in some instances. This issue has now been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>cx_Oracle database calls that use SessionPool objects were not recorded</strong></p>
    <p>When using the cx_Oracle SessionPool interace, database transactions made through the acquired pool connection may not have been reported. Database transactions that using connections generated by SessionPool are now reported as expected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SQL targets for call statements may contain a period</strong></p>
    <p>For a SQL command like <code>CALL foo.bar(:baz)</code>, APM would show metrics under the target name <code>foo</code> instead of the full name <code>foo.bar</code>. This has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
