<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Security fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In Linux, at startup, the agent ensures it has ownership of the integrations temporary data folder, <strong>/tmp/nr-integrations/</strong>. This ensures only the agent/integrations can write into it negating potential abuse that could result in Denial/Degradation of Service.</li>
</ul>
