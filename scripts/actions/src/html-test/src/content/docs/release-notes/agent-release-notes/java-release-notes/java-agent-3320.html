  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Performance Improvements</p>
    <p>Improvements in Java agent startup time, particularly on modular ClassLoader architectures (such as JBoss)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed bug in spymemcached instrumentation that would incorrectly name segments in <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details">transaction traces</a> that contained “get-and-touch” operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved Play 2.5 instrumentation</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed memory leak for large POST requests.</li>
      <li>Fixed incorrect response times. Previously, large uploads could cause inflated response times.</li>
      <li>The agent now tracks PlayRequestHandler and no longer shows the short-lived NettyDispatcher transactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug that could cause cross application tracing to display URLs as “Unknown” in <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details">transaction traces</a> when the URL did not include the port number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in Jetty 9.3 instrumentation where transactions were not reported and memory was leaked if an incoming async request was wrapped by a framework or Jetty itself.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
