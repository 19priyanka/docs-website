<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Node v8 is officially supported with the exception of <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</p>
    <p>Support for the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"><code>async/await</code></a> keywords is coming in a future release. Until this support is added, New Relic does not support and highly discourages using the Node.js agent with applications that utilize <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, as it could result in transaction state loss and data being mixed between transactions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed issues related to changes in the core networking modules that resulted in transaction state loss. Also instrumented new asynchronous API methods in crypto and <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.0.0/docs/api/inspector.html">inspector</a>.</li>
</ul>
