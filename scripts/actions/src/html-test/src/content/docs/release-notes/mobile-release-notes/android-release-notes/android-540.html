<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Interaction tracing can now be globally disabled with the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-sdk-api/new-relic-mobile-sdk-api/work-android-sdk-api#disable-interactions">new API method</a>, <code>NewRelic.withInteractionTracing(boolean)</code>. This method should be called prior to starting the agent, but it can be changed any time thereafter. Interaction tracing will be disabled after the agent has started; interactions for any activity or methods executed prior to starting the agent may still appear in the Interactions page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A bug introduced in the previous release that resulted in missing analytics data in crash reports has been fixed.</li>
  <li>The session ID is now correctly updated when the app returns to foreground. Unique session counts were not affected.</li>
  <li>Additional safeguards were added to prevent agent from starting or harvesting when app is in the background.</li>
</ul>
