<h2>v6.3.0</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Official Rails 6.0 support</strong></p>
    <p>This version of the agent has been verified against the Rails 6.0.0 release.</p>
    <p>As ActiveRecord 4, 5, and 6 use the same New Relic instrumentation, the <code>disable_active_record_4</code> and <code>disable_active_record_5</code> settings in NewRelic.yml are being deprecated in favor of the new <code>disable_active_record_notifications</code>. This new setting will affect the instrumentation of ActiveRecord 4, 5, and 6. The deprecated settings will be removed in a future release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bugfix for <code>newrelic deployments</code> script</strong></p>
    <p>For applications housed in the EU, the <code>newrelic deployments</code> script included with previous versions of the agent would fail with the following message: <code>Deployment not recorded: Application does not exist.</code> This is because the script would attempt to send the deployment notification to the US region. The deployment script now sends deployments to the correct region.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Faster ActiveRecord connection resolution</strong></p>
    <p>This version of the agent uses the faster ActiveRecord connection resolution that Rails 6.0 uses, even on previous versions of Rails. Thanks to Callum Jones for the contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Support non-ascii characters in hostnames</strong></p>
    <p>Previous versions of the agent would frequently log warnings like: <code>log writing failed. "\xE2" from ASCII-8BIT to UTF-8</code> if the hostname contained a non-ascii character. This version of the agent will no longer log these warnings. Thanks to Rafael Petry for the contribution!</p>
