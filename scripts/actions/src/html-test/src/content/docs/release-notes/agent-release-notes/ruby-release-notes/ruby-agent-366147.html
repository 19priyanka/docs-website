<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>HTTPClient and Curb support</p>
    <p>The Ruby agent now supports the HTTPClient and Curb HTTP libraries! Cross application tracing and more is fully supported for these libraries. For more details see <a href="https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-http-clients">https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/ruby-http-clients</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sinatra startup improvements</p>
    <p>In earlier agent versions, newrelic_rpm had to be required after Sinatra to get instrumentation. Now the agent should start when your Sinatra app starts up in rackup, thin, unicorn, or similar web servers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Puma clustered mode support</p>
    <p>Clustered mode in Puma was not reporting data without manually adding a hook to Puma's configuration. The agent will now automatically add this hook.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SSL certificate verification</p>
    <p>Early versions of the agent's SSL support provided an option to skip certificate verification. This option has been removed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
