<h1>New Relic Ruby Agent Release Notes</h1>
<h2>v6.11.0</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Infinite Tracing</strong></p>
    <p>This release adds support for <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing">Infinite Tracing</a>. Infinite Tracing observes 100% of your distributed traces and provides visualizations for the most actionable data. With Infinite Tracing, you get examples of errors and long-running traces so you can better diagnose and troubleshoot your systems.</p>
    <p>Configure your agent to send traces to a trace observer in New Relic Edge. View distributed traces through New Relic’s UI. There is no need to install a collector on your network.</p>
    <p>Infinite Tracing is currently available on a sign-up basis. If you would like to participate, please contact your sales representative.</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Bugfix: Cross Application Tracing (CAT) adds a missing field to response</strong></p>
    <p>Previously, the CAT header was missing a reserved field that would lead to an error in the Go Agent's processing of incoming headers from the Ruby Agent. This fix adds that missing field to the headers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bugfix: Environment Report now supports Rails >= 6.1</strong></p>
    <p>The API changed for how database connections are accessed in Rails versions starting with 6.1 to support multiple database feature. The Environment report was enhanced to use the Rails >= 6.1 API with fallback to old API when that fails.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Sébastien Dubois (sedubois) for reporting this issue and contribution!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bugfix: Eliminate warnings appearing when using <code>add_method_tracer</code> with Ruby 2.7</strong></p>
    <p>Previously, using <code>add_method_tracer</code> with Ruby 2.7 to trace a method that included keyword arguments resulted in warning messages: <code>warning: Using the last argument as keyword parameters is deprecated; maybe ** should be added to the call</code>. These messages no longer appear.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Harm de Wit and Atsuo Fukaya for reporting the issue!</p>
