<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New API method for configuring logging verbosity.</p>
    <p>You can now choose how verbose the agent will be at boot by chaining withLogLevel() before your NewRelic start() call. The default level is INFO.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New API method for renaming inflight interactions.</p>
    <p>Call NewRelic.setInteractionName() at the beginning of your onCreate() method to set a custom name for your interaction. This usually defaults to the name of the Activity subclass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Method tracing optimizations.</p>
    <p>Weâ€™ve carefully reviewed the code involved in tracing instrumented methods and reduced its CPU and memory overhead substantially.</p>
  </li>
