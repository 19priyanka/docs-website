<h3>Notes</h3>
<h3>End of Life Notices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This release no longer supports BSD (either 32-bit or 64-bit) or the 32-bit variant of Mac OS X.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Add Laravel 4.0 support</p>
    <p>Laravel version 4.0 or greater is now supported natively. The naming scheme that we use follows the scheme developed by Patrick Leckey at Intouch Insight, and we are very grateful for his assistance.</p>
    <p>If you are already using the LaravelNewrelicServiceProvider from <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/intouch/laravel-newrelic">https://packagist.org/packages/intouch/laravel-newrelic</a> then we recommend removing that from the list of service providers, and relying on our native support instead.</p>
    <p>However, if you are using the custom naming mechanism with 'name_provider' from the intouch/laravel-newrelic package, then those transaction names will take precedence over our automatically generated transaction names. If you do use 'name_provider', please write us and let us know what your namer does so we might extend our built in capabilities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Improved real user monitoring Javascript insertion.</p>
    <p>The real user monitoring Javascript loader will now be injected after any meta charset tag, ensuring that the meta charset tag is close to the beginning of the page.</p>
    <p>The real user monitoring Javascript footer will no longer be inserted into HTML comments or nested HTML iframes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Properly observe newrelic.ignored_params when capturing the request's URL.</p>
    <p>If newrelic.capture_params is true then the agent will capture the values within the $_REQUEST parameter and the full raw URL of the request. The contents of newrelic.ignored_params are used to selectively ignore values from $_REQUEST. The presence of newrelic.ignored_params will now also prevent the capturing of query parameters in the request URL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix transaction naming when newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions is present.</p>
    <p>When newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions had a non-empty value, the URL was being used as the default web transaction name instead of the PHP filename.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Print backtrace to log file in the event of a segmentation fault.</p>
    <p>This functionality has been missing since release 4.4.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
