<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent introduces distributed tracing, adds improvement to our Pyramid instrumentation, adds support for custom CA bundles, and contains bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Distributed tracing support</strong></p>
    <p>Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.</p>
    <p>Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing">transition guide</a> before you enable this feature.</p>
    <p>To enable distributed tracing, add <code>distributed_tracing.enabled = true</code> to your newrelic.ini file or use the environment variable <code>NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add support for tracing Pyramid tweens</strong></p>
    <p><a href="https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/glossary.html#term-tween">Pyramid tweens</a> are now automatically timed and added to the transaction detail view. The time spent in a Pyramid tween will be displayed in the transaction breakdown table and in the trace details of a transaction trace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Provide configuration option for custom CA bundle</strong></p>
    <p>Customers can now use the <code>ca_bundle_path</code> configuration option or set the <code>NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH</code> environment variable to set the path to a local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Custom Insights event data attached to transactions in excess of 100 events were omitted</strong></p>
    <p>The agent may have failed to send custom event data (record_custom_event) to insights when recorded as part of a Transaction containing over 100 custom events. This issue has now been corrected.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
