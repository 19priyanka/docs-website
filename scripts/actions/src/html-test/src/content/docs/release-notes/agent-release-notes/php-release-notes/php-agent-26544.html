<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There is an outstanding issue with the Zend View component where it kills the output buffer that auto-RUM relies on, so for this environment you will need to disable auto-RUM by setting newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument = 0 and doing manual instrumentation for the time being.</li>
  <li>Fixed a potential spin-loop that would cause the agent to consume 100% of the CPU if the underlying OS did not allow the daemon connection (even if the daemon was up and running).</li>
  <li>Only apply Real User Monitoring scripts to HTML content.</li>
  <li>Fix an issue if auto-RUM encountered content it couldn't parse, it would cause a segmentation violation and cause Apache to core-dump.</li>
</ul>
