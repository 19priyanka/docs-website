<h3>Notes</h3>
<h4>Improvements</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Improved network instrumentation performance resulting from a change in the way we detect the network connection type, which also prevents the potential for a deadlock under high concurrency.</li>
  <li>The agent will raise an exception with detailed information in the event it detects a fatal conflict where another library interferes with our code instrumentation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fixes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Resolves an issue with ASI instrumentation that could cause a crash when receiving certain network level errors.</li>
  <li>Resolves a deadlock scenario that could occur during certain high-load circumstances. </li>
  <li>Fixes an issue where heavy network load could potentially cause the OS Reachability functionality to hang, forcing the OS to terminate the app on launch. </li>
  <li>NewRelic.h was updated to correct syntax issues causing compiler warnings.</li>
</ul>
