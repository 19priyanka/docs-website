<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Support for Distributed tracing</strong></p>
    <p>Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.</p>
    <p>Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing">transition guide</a> before you enable this feature.</p>
    <p>To enable distributed tracing, two parameters should be changed in the newrelic.ini file:</p>
    <pre><code>newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true
</code></pre>
    <p>and</p>
    <pre><code>newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0
</code></pre>

  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A bug in the PHP agent resulted in databaseCallCount attributes no longer being attached to Transaction events. The 8.4 release restores these attributes.</li>
  <li>Predis 2 cluster connections could not be instrumented due to internal changes in Predis. The 8.4 release fixes this.</li>
</ul>
