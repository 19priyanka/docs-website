<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Adds support for running integrations as different users by setting the <code>integration_user</code> attribute in the instances section of the config file.</li>
  <li>Stops setting the <code>NRIA_CACHE_PATH</code> variable for integrations. This variable was used by pre-V3 SDK integrations for storing cache data. Without it the integrations will default to a <code>/tmp</code> directory like SDK V3 integrations.</li>
  <li>Attaches <code>integration_user</code> attribute to the integration samples.</li>
  <li>Adds new user/group <code>nri-agent</code> to be used in different user modes.</li>
</ul>
