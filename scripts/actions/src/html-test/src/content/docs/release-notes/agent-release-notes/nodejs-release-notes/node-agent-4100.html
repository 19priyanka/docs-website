<h3>Improvements</h3>

    <p>Thanks to Yuri Tkachenko (@tamtamchik) for the contribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed bug preventing Distributed Tracing (DT) from fully functioning when Cross Application Tracing (CAT) was disabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Renames better-cat integration test organization to be distributed-tracing and updated some test verbiage to use DT or distributed tracing instead of CAT or cross application tracing.</p>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The agent will no longer break express routers in the case of using regex paths in a list.</p>
    <p>Previously, the agent would overwrite the regex with the source of the regex. The agent now makes a copy of the route array and mutates that instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attributes will now be properly propagated to PageView events.</p>
    <p>The agent may now be configured to pass attributes along to the browser agent. The attributes that match the include/exclude rules in the <code>browser_monitor.attributes</code> section will now be placed on PageView events.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
