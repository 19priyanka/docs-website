<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Support for Distributed tracing</strong></p>
    <p>Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before.</p>
    <p>Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services.</p>
    <p>Refer to the New Relic <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/enable-distributed-tracing-your-c-applications">C SDK documentation</a> for more information on enabling distributed tracing for the C SDK.</p>
