<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Agent now respects attribute type restrictions on trace/segment attributes, as well as error event/trace attributes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes potential for <code>RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded</code> error on Transaction/Trace end.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Custom events no longer accept attributes with invalid types.</p>
    <p>The only attribute types accepted by the backend are <code>boolean</code>, <code>string</code>, and <code>number</code>; any attribute assigned to a custom event outside these types would be dropped on ingest. The agent now filters these attributes out, and logs out a helpful message detailing the issue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
