<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added <code>nonce</code> option for <code>newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader()</code></p>
    <p>This allows people to pass in a string to be injected as the <code>nonce</code> property of the generated script tag. Special thanks to Jo√£o Vieira (@joaovieira) for contributing this feature!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expose the External segment on the <code>http</code> request instance for outbound calls.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added check to mark Hapi <code>'onPreResponse'</code> extensions as error handlers.</p>
    <p>Previously, the agent was unable to mark any Hapi errors as handled, even if they were, resulting in inaccurate reporting. This change assumes that <code>'onPreResponse'</code> extensions act as error handlers, so errors are only reported if they persist to the final response.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
