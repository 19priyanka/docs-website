  <li>
    <p>Initialize New Relic Agent before config initializers</p>
    <p>When running in a Rails environment, the agent registers an initializer that starts the agent. This initializer is now defined to run before config/initializers. Previously, the ordering was not specified for the initializer. This change guarantees the agent will started by the time your initializers run, so you can safely reference the Agent in your custom initializers. Thanks to Tony Ta for the contribution.</p>

    <p>Ruby 2.5 Support</p>
    <p>The Ruby Agent has been verified to run under Ruby 2.5.</p>

  <li>
    <p><code>request.uri</code> Collected as an Agent Attribute</p>
    <p>Users can now control the collection of <code>request.uri</code> on errors and transaction traces. Previously it was always collected without the ability to turn it off. It is now an agent attribute that can be controlled via the attributes config. For more information on agent attributes <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes">see here</a>.</p>
