<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for Custom Metrics</p>
    <p>Custom metrics provides a way to send additional metrics up to New Relic APM, which can be viewed with Custom Dashboards. We have two APIs for this, recordMetric(name, value) and incrementMetric(name[, value]). Read more about <a href="/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/nodejs-custom-metrics">Node.js custom metrics</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in deeply nested transactions.</p>
    <p>Previously we allowed transactions to be nested to any depth. We've found in some cases this causes stack depth problems and are now limiting to 900 segments per transaction. We will still collect metrics on all segments, but transaction traces will only show the first 900.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug where custom tracers would show 0 time if the transaction ended n them.</p>
    <p>This may change the times you see for other types of tracers by a small amount. The change will reflect slightly more accurate timing.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
