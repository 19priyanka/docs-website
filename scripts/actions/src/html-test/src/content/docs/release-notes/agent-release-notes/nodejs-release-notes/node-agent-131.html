<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Always cast ignored status codes to numbers so that people using environment-variable configuration or strings in config still get error status ignored properly.</li>
  <li>If you disabled server-side configuration, the server was still able to set the value of apdex_t for your app. This was an oversight, and has been corrected.</li>
  <li>Before, if you had request renaming rules, if the end result was the same as the match pattern (mapping <code>/path</code> to <code>/path</code>), they would be silently ignored. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>MySQL instrumentation handles callback more consistently, so the transaction tracer doesn't get confused and stop tracking transactions with MySQL calls in them.</li>
</ul>
