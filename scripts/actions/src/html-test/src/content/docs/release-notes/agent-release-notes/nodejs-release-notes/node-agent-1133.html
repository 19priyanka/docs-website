<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in Cross Application Tracing where the agent would sometimes attempt to set a header after headers had already been sent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Replaced the logger with one that is handles file writes properly lowering overall resource usage.</p>
    <p>This is a small change with a large impact. <code>fs.createWriteStream</code> returns whether data was queued or not. If it is queued it is recommended to wait on a <code>drain</code> event but this isn't mandatory. Most loggers we've found ignore this event which leads to many writes getting buffered and a rapid increase in native heap size as well as lowering the process's ability to respond to requests.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
