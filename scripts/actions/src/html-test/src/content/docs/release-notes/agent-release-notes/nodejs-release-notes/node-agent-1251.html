<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Corrected an issue where the agent would sometimes crash looking up the port of the HTTP server that a request came from.</p>
    <p>Previously, the agent assumed the HTTP server would always have an address, unfortunately this isn't the case if the HTTP server's <code>.close()</code> has been called.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
