<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Removed automatic installation of <code>@newrelic/native-metrics</code>.</p>
    <p>Due to the way npm v3+ flatten dependencies, a bug in the version of npm packaged with Node v5, and npm v1's ungraceful handling of scoped packages we have opted to not automatically install this module.</p>
    <p>If you would like to see native metrics for your application, you can add the <code>@newrelic/native-metrics</code> module to your <code>package.json</code> and the Node Agent will automatically pick it up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Corrected attribution of the Bluebird patch in the last release's notes.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Matt Lavin (@mdlavin) for this correction!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
