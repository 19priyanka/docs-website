<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added replacement of on-host integration's remote entity-names; when a loopback address is found, it will be replaced with agent entity-name. This change will be applied in the entity key and the hostname metric field (if present), when the data comes from an integration using protocol V3. See <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/infra-integrations-sdk/blob/master/docs/protocol-v3.md">protocol V3 documentation</a> for further details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed unreported processes issue caused by the inability to parse a different format of /proc//stat.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem that caused the Windows agent to submit <code>os:"unknown"</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Security updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a low security issue that caused the Windows agent to periodically access <code>C:\etc</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
