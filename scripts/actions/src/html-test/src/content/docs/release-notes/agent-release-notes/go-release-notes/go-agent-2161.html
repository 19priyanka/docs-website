<h3>If you do not manually take steps to use the new v3 folder, as described below, you will not see any changes in your agent.</h3>
<p>This 2.16.1 release includes a new v3.0 folder which contains the pre-release of Go agent v3.0; Go agent v3.0 includes breaking changes. We are seeking feedback and hope that you will look this over and test out the changes prior to the official release.</p>
<p><strong>This is not an official 3.0 release, it is just a vehicle to gather feedback on proposed changes</strong>. It is not tagged as 3.0 in Github and the 3.0 release is not yet available to update in your Go mod file. In order to test out these changes, you will need to clone this repo in your Go source directory, under <code>[go-src-dir]/src/github.com/newrelic/go-agent</code>. Once you have the source checked out, you will need to follow the steps in the second section of <a href="https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/v3/MIGRATION.md">v3/MIGRATION.md</a>.</p>
