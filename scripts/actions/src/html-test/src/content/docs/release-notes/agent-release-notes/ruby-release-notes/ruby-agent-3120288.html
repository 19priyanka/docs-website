<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Flexible capturing of attributes</p>
    <p>The Ruby agent now allows you more control over exactly which request parameters and job arguments are attached to transaction traces, traced errors, and Insights events. For details, see:</p>

  <li>
    <p>Fixed missing URIs in traces for retried Excon requests</p>
    <p>If Excon's idempotent option retried a request, the transaction trace node for the call would miss having the URI assigned. This has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capturing request parameters from rescued exceptions in Grape</p>
    <p>If an exception was handled via a rescue_from in Grape, request parameters were not properly set on the error trace. This has been fixed. Thanks to Ankit Shah for helping us spot the bug.</p>
