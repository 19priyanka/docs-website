<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed a bug in custom event recording limits.</p>
    <p>Previously, the agent would use the config value for max events (default of 1000) for the first harvest of custom events, then would use an internal default for the reservoir with max of 10 events for each harvest after that, resulting in less than the expected number of events being sent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Exposed the <code>custom_insights_events</code> settings in the user config.</p>
    <p>You can now set <code>custom_insights_events.enabled</code> and <code>custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored</code> in your <code>newrelic.js</code>.</p>
    <p>Read more about these settings in our <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#custom_events">documentation</a>.</p>
