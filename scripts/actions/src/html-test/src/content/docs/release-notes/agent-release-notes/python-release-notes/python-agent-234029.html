<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This release of the Python agent provides support for Labels and Rollups, making it possible to organize your applications in the APM UI into meaningful categories.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using <strong>easy_install/pip/distribute</strong> via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from our <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>
<p>For a list of known issues with the Python agent see <a href="/docs/python/status-of-python-agent">Status of the Python agent</a>.</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Labels and Rollups</strong></p>
    <p>The Python agent now supports the ability to apply labels to applications, so that you can easily sort, filter, and page through all of the applications on your account's Applications list.</p>
    <p>Configuration can be done in the newrelic.ini file:</p>
    <pre><code>labels = Server:One;Data Center:Primary
</code></pre>
    <p>Labels can also be configured by setting a <code>NEW_RELIC_LABELS</code> environment variable:</p>
    <pre><code>NEW_RELIC_LABELS=Server:One;Data Center:Primary
</code></pre>
    <p>More information on using labels to categorize your applications can be found in the <a href="/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/categories-rollups-organizing-your-apps">New Relic APM documentation</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New CPU Reporting in Environment Snapshot</strong></p>
    <p>Previously, the Python agent captured two CPU-related values to report to the Environment Snapshot: Logical Processors and Physical Processors. Now, it captures the following three values:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Logical Processors</strong>: The total number of hyper-threaded execution contexts available, including execution contexts that may exist on the same core. This value remains unchanged from previous agents.</li>
      <li><strong>Physical Cores</strong>: The total number of physical CPU cores available, counting hyper-threaded siblings as a single core. This value was previously reported as "Physical Processors."</li>
      <li><strong>Physical Processor Packages</strong>: The total number of processor packages or dies (each of which may contain multiple physical cores). This value is new with this agent release.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A "Runtime Error: transaction already active" will no longer be seen in the case where the agent created nested transaction wrappers and <code>newrelic.agent.ignore_transaction()</code> was called within the outer wrapper but outside the inner wrapper. Previously, this error could have also been triggered when using the WSGI environment setting for <code>newrelic.ignore_transaction</code> set by SetEnv in mod_wsgi.</li>
  <li>Prior to this version, the HTTP_REFERER URL reported for a transaction contained query parameters, even if the <code>capture_params</code> setting was set to False. Now, the <code>capture_params</code> setting is respected when reporting the HTTP_REFERER URL.</li>
</ul>
