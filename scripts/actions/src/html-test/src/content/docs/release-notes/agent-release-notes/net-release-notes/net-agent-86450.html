<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through your distributed system. By showing the distributed activity through a unified view, you can troubleshoot and understand a complex system better than ever before. Distributed tracing is available with an APM Pro or equivalent subscription. To see a complete distributed trace, you need to enable the feature on a set of neighboring services. Enabling distributed tracing changes the behavior of some New Relic features, so carefully consult the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/transition-guide-distributed-tracing">transition guide</a> before you enable this feature.</li>
  <li>To enable distributed tracing, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#distributed_tracing">.NET Agent configuration</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
