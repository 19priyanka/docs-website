<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for control characters in Insights data. Control characters will now be displayed by their common escaped character representation. For example: an 'end-of-text' control character will be displayed as '^C'.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Removed instrumentation of ASI networking framework. This prevents collisions with Apple's private API scans, which produces a false positive when scanning our instrumentation of this library. We recommend anyone still using ASI for networking to use our <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/work-ios-sdk-api">custom network instrumentation</a> tools going forward.</li>
</ul>
