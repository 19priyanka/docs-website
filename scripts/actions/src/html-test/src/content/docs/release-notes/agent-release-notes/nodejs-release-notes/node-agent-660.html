<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added support for <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing">Infinite Tracing on New Relic Edge</a>.</p>
    <p>Infinite Tracing observes 100% of your distributed traces and provides visualizations for the most actionable data so you have the examples of errors and long-running traces so you can better diagnose and troubleshoot your systems.</p>
    <p>You configure your agent to send traces to a trace observer in New Relic Edge. You view your distributed traces through the New Relicâ€™s UI. There is no need to install a collector on your network.</p>
    <p>Infinite Tracing is currently available on a sign-up basis. If you would like to participate, please contact your sales representative.</p>
