<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Removed the <code>ssl</code> configuration option.</p>
    <p>TLS is now always used in communication with New Relic Servers. The <code>ssl</code> configuration value and <code>NEW_RELIC_USE_SSL</code> environment value are no longer used. Setting either value to anything other than <code>true</code> will result in a warning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security bulletin <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts-partnerships/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-06">NR18-05</a>:</p>
    <p>Fixes issue introduced in 2.8.0 where the agent may have captured all transaction attributes, even with High Security Mode enabled on the account. This may have included sensitive data attached to transactions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All request parameters now prefixed with <code>request.parameters.</code>.</p>
    <p>Previously request parameters such as route and query parameters were added as attributes without any name changes. For example <code>/foo?bar=value</code> would add the attribute <code>bar</code> to the transaction. Now this attribute would be named <code>request.parameters.bar</code>.</p>
    <p>Any Insights dashboards, alerts, or other NRQL queries using these attributes must be updated to use the new attribute names.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adds support for EU Datacenter</p>
