<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A number of improvements and fixes to transaction naming rules.</p>
    <p>Added attributes <code>terminate_chain</code>, <code>replace_all</code>, and <code>precedence</code> to allow more control over how naming rules are executed. Please see the updated documentation in our README file.</p>
    <p>The order in which naming rules are executed can now be reversed with a feature flag <code>reverse_naming_rules</code>.</p>
    <p>When applying naming rules, the regular expression matching is now case insensitive.</p>

    <p>We have also improved our trace logging around transaction naming.</p>
