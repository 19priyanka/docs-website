<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This release of the Python agent is a hotfix release to address a problem introduced in our last release (v2.72.0.52) where users of the <code>psycopg2</code> Postgresql database adapter could see extra Datastore entries in the Breakdown Table on the Transactions page in APM.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from our <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>
<h3>Bug Fix</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Remove extra Datastore segments from the Transactions Breakdown Table</strong></p>
    <p>Due to the extra Datastore segments in the Breakdown Table on the Transactions page in APM, the "% Time" column would add up to greater than 100%. This problem has now been fixed. Users of <code>psycopg2</code> who are using v2.72.0.52 of the Python agent are encouraged to upgrade to this latest version.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
