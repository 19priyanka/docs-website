<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes a bug where the .NET Agent was not handling exceptions coming from HttpRequest.Path and HttpRequest.Url properties. Because the exception was unhandled users would see a System.Web.HttprequestValidationException in their log files and in some cases could miss transactions being reported.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where the .NET Agent was throwing null reference exceptions when tracing some SQL commands where there was no transaction available.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where the .NET Agent was reporting StackExchange.Redis call times incorrectly. Now, the agent reports the correct call times for apps that use StackExchange.Redis synchronously.</li>
</ul>
