<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Domain error handlers will now be scoped to the transaction the error occurred in.</p>
    <p>Previously, the <code>'error'</code> event handlers would not be scoped to a transaction causing our API methods to not associate data correctly (e.g. using <code>noticeError</code> would not associate the error with the transaction and would instead be unscoped).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reworked the SQL parser to handle new lines in the query.</p>
    <p>Previously the agent would have difficulty classifying queries with new lines in them. Thanks to Libin Lu (@evollu) for the fix!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Postgres instrumentation is now compatible with inputs with text getter attributes.</p>
    <p>Thanks again to Libin Lu (@evollu) for the fix!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
