<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Customers using Tomcat, WebSphere Liberty, or Resin now have data source information available. Data source information includes the number of active and idle connections, as well as the maximum possible connections. This information can be seen under the Data Source tab on the JVMs page</li>
  <li>CompletableFuture instrumentation is more efficient</li>
  <li>Disabling SSL connections to New Relic has been deprecated. SSL connections are enabled by default. In a future release, the option to disable SSL will be removed.</li>
