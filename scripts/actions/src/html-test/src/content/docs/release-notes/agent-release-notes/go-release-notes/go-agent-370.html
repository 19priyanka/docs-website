<h2>3.7.0</h2>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When <code>Config.Transport</code> is nil, no longer use the <code>http.DefaultTransport</code> when communicating with the New Relic backend. This addresses an issue with shared transports as described in <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33006">https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33006</a>.</li>
  <li>If a timeout occurs when attempting to send data to the New Relic backend, instead of dropping the data, we save it and attempt to send it with the next harvest. Note <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/apm-data-retention">data retention limits</a> still apply and the agent will still start to drop data when these limits are reached. We attempt to keep the highest priority events and traces.</li>
</ul>
