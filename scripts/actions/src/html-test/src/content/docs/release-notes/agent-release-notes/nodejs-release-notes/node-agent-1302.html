<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Added instrumentation of the param() function in Express.</p>
    <p>The agent will now create metrics and transaction segments when the Express param() function is called as a part of a route. This also fixes an issue with transaction naming when the HTTP response is ended within a param() method.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed an issue with naming Express transactions that result in 404 errors.</p>
    <p>Previously transactions were not always correctly normalized for URLs that caused 404 errors. The transactions will now always be reported with the same normalized name (e.g. "get /").</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixed instrumentation of Express v4.0 - v4.5.</p>
    <p>Previously transactions were not correctly named on older versions of Express 4.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Minor upates to logging.</li>
</ul>
