<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unified view for SQL database and NoSQL datastore products. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/databases-slow-queries-dashboard">https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/databases-slow-queries-dashboard</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Non-IIS applications no longer use the process name as an application name unless no other name is provided. This brings non-IIS application naming in-line with IIS application naming and all of the same naming rules should apply.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where simple transactions wouldn't be available to insights for queries. This was most likely to occur with custom applications or WCF applications.</li>
  <li>Fixes a security issue where proxy credentials could be written to the agent log file if you supplied them in the hostname (e.g., user:<a href="mailto:password@proxy.com">password@proxy.com</a>:1234).</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that caused the .NET agent to corrupt some non-HTML resources if browser monitoring was enabled.</li>
</ul>
