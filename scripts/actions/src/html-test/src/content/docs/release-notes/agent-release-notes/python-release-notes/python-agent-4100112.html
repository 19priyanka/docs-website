<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This release of the Python agent adds support for excluding attributes from span events and transaction trace segments, adds a new api called add_custom_parameters, and includes various bug fixes.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release">download site</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add ability to exclude attributes from span events and transaction trace segments</strong></p>
    <p>This release adds support to exclude attributes (such as <code>http.url</code>) from span events (via the <code>span_events.include</code>/<code>span_events.exclude</code> options) and from transaction segments (via the <code>transaction_segments.include</code>/<code>transaction_segments.exclude</code> option).</p>
    <p>As with other attribute destinations, these new options will inherit values from the top-level <code>attributes.include</code>/<code>attributes.exclude</code> settings. See the documentation for more information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add public add_custom_parameters API</strong></p>
    <p>The method add_custom_parameters on Transaction is now exposed through newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Transaction counts were not reported for aiohttp's built-in error pages</strong></p>
    <p>When a built-in error route was reached in aiohttp (such as a 404 due to a missing route), transactions were not recorded. As a result, the transaction counts may have been artificially low. aiohttp system route traffic will now be reported.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>aiohttp cross application tracing linking to non-Python applications may have been omitted if using multidict&#x3C;3.0</strong></p>
    <p>For aiohttp users using multidict versions less than 3.0, cross application tracing HTTP headers may have been generated in a way that was incompatible with non-Python applications. Headers are now generated in a format compatible with all New Relic agents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>aiohttp 3.5.x versions generated agent instrumentation errors</strong></p>
    <p>The agent previously failed to instrument aiohttp applications running versions 3.5.0 and greater. The agent now supports aiohttp versions up to 3.5.1.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
