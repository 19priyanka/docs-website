<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>serverless_mode</code> feature flag is now enabled by default.</li>
  <li>Added <code>instrumentLoadedModule</code> method to the API, allowing end-users to manually apply an instrumentation to a loaded module. Useful for cases where some module needs to be loaded before newrelic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Removed older versions of Cassandra from versioned tests</li>
  <li>For debug/test runs, shimmer will now cleanup the __NR_shim property on instrumented methods. This leftover property did not result in any negative behaviors but cleaning up for thoroughness and to prevent potential confusion.</li>
  <li>Fixes <code>recordMiddleware</code> promise parenting for certain cases where child segments are created within resolving middleware <code>next()</code> promises.</li>
</ul>
