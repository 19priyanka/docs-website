<h2>New Features</h2>
<h3>Added support for custom attributes on PageViewTiming events</h3>
<p>Custom attributes created using the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/setcustomattribute-browser-agent-api">setCustomAttribute API method</a> will now be included in all <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/pageviewtiming-async-or-dynamic-page-details">PageViewTiming events</a>.</p>
<h2>Issue Resolutions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>[SPA- BrowserInteractions] Fixed an issue resulting from too many fetch requests</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resolved a bug throwing a null reference error during browser interactions where more than 128 fetch requests were recorded and distributed tracing was enabled.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[PageViewTiming] Fixed an edge-case issue with the paint timing instrumentation</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In cases when nothing was painted to screen before the load event, the agent would throw an error. We have added a guard for this scenario.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>[PageViewTiming] Fixed issue with Largest Contentful Paint recording</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The browser agent stops recording largest contentful paint after 60 seconds on a page. We fixed an issue where recording continued beyond that threshold.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
