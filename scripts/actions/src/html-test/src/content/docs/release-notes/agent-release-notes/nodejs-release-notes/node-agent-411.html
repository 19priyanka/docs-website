<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Optimized <code>unhandledRejection</code> reporting when using <code>async_hooks</code>.</li>
  <li>Replaced all uses of <code>util._extend</code> with <code>Object.assign</code>.</li>
  <li>Completed TODOs regarding the Node 0.10 and 0.12 deprecation.</li>
  <li>Added PriorityQueue serialization benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The agent no longer resizes the metric timeslice start time to be the earliest start time of the transactions that finish during the timeslice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Background transactions created may now be named through <code>API#setTransactionName</code>.</p>
    <p>Previously, the agent didn't respect the transaction naming precedence for background transactions. Background transaction naming behavior is now in line with web transaction behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Logger no longer tries to create very large log messages.</p>
    <p>When a message is created that would be too large to log, a process warning is emitted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The agent will now respect event count limits when merging data from a failed send.</p>
    <p>Previously, when merging data into an event pool the agent wouldn't maintain the size limit of the reservoir.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added check for a route prefix when wrapping Hapi route handlers.</p>
    <p>Previously, route prefixes specified via plugin options weren't being included in transaction names. Now, if the agent finds a route prefix associated with a given realm, it is prepended to the route path in the transaction name.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
