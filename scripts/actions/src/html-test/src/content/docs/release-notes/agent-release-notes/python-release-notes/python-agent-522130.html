<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix thread utilization data on agent versions v5.x.x</strong></p>
    <p>Thread utilization data was not reported for agents v5.x.x, resulting in missing data on the capacity analysis page. The agent will now report thread utilization data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fix untraced database calls when using pymysql context manager assignments</strong></p>
    <p>When using context managers to create and assign a cursor in pymysql, database calls on that cursor object were not traced. Database calls in pymysql are now properly traced.</p>
