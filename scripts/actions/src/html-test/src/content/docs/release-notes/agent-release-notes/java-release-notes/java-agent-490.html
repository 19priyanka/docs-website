<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The 'request.uri' attribute is now included in Transaction events and corresponding Transaction Error events. As a result this attribute can now be queried in Insights. It may be excluded via the exclude list in the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/attributes/enabling-disabling-attributes-java">attributes stanza of the yaml config file</a>. It is also excluded when High Security Mode is enabled.</li>
  <li>Distributed Tracing can now be enabled at the same time as <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/automatic-application-naming">auto app naming</a>. Each application created by this setting will share an event reservoir for Distributed Tracing.</li>
  <li>Updates Akka HTTP instrumentation to support the newest version of Akka HTTP, 10.1.5 and above.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes a possible NullPointerException that could occur in Hystrix instrumentation and propagate into application code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes a bug where usage of the HttpsURLConnection getInputStream() method could cause some scoped external metrics to be double-counted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes an issue that prevents the agent from connecting to an HTTP proxy that does not requires a username or password.</p>
    <p>When configured to use an HTTP proxy by using proxy_host and proxy_port, the agent would look for proxy_username and proxy_password. If those weren't provided, the agent would use an empty string for proxy_username and proxy_password.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prevents unnecessary dependencies from showing up in the newrelic-agent pom</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes deadlocks occurring in agent 4.7.0 that were caused by instrumentation of classes in the <code>sun/nio/cs/.*</code> package</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes an issue where custom jmx metrics with '.'s in the attribute name would not get recorded.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
