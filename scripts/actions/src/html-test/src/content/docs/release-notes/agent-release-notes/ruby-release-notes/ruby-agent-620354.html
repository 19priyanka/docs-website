<h2>v6.2.0</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for superfluous <code>Empty JSON response</code> error messages</p>
    <p>Version 6.1.0 of the agent frequently logged error messages about an empty JSON response, when no error had occurred. These logs no longer appear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bugfix for <code>Unable to calculate elapsed transaction time</code> warning messages</p>
    <p>Ruby Agent versions 5.4 through 6.1, when running in jruby without ObjectSpace enabled, would occasionally log a warning indicating that the agent was unable to calculate the elapsed transaction time. When this log statement appeared, the affected transactions would not be included in the data displayed on the capacity analysis page. These transactions are now correctly recorded.</p>
