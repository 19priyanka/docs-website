<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mongo instrumentation improvements</p>
    <p>Users of the 'mongo' MongoDB client gem will get more detailed instrumentation including support for some operations that were not previously captured, and separation of aggregate metrics for web transactions from background jobs.</p>
    <p>An issue with ensure_index when passed a symbol or string was also fixed. Thanks Maxime RETY for the report!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More accurate error tracing in Rails 4</p>
    <p>Traced errors in Rails 4 applications will now be correctly associated with the transaction they occurred in, and custom attributes attached to the transaction will be correctly attached to the traced error as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More accurate partial-rendering metrics for Rails 4</p>
    <p>View partials are now correctly treated as sub-components of the containing template render in Rails 4 applications, meaning that the app server breakdown graphs for Rails 4 transactions should be more accurate and useful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved Unicorn 4.8.0 compatibility</p>
    <p>A rare issue that could lead to spurrious traced errors on app startup for applications using Unicorn 4.8.0 has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>meta_request gem compatibility</p>
    <p>An incompatibility with the meta_request gem has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Typhoeus 0.6.4+ compatibility</p>
    <p>A potential crash with Typhoeus 0.6.4+ when passing a URI object instead of a String instance to one of Typhoeus's HTTP request methods has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sequel single threaded mode fix</p>
    <p>The agent will no longer attempt to run EXPLAIN queries for slow SQL statements issued using the Sequel gem in single-threaded mode, since doing so could potentially cause crashes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additional functionality for add_custom_parameters</p>
    <p>Calling add_custom_parameters adds parameters to the system codenamed Rubicon. For more information, see <a href="http://newrelic.com/software-analytics">http://newrelic.com/software-analytics</a></p>
