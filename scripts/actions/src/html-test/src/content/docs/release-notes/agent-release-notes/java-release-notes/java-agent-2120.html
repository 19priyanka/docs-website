<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Agent reports jars used by applications to the Environments tab in the UI</p>
    <p>The Environments tab in the New Relic UI now shows the jars used by your application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: In certain cases, auto-RUM of JSP breaks HTML</p>
    <p>An angle-bracket in quotes in a META tag causes the agent to produce invalid HTML for JSP. The fix produces valid HTML for this case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: Key Transaction ApdexT value not used</p>
    <p>In v2.10 - v2.11, the application-level ApdexT value is used for Key Transactions rather than the ApdexT for the Key Transaction itself. In this release, the ApdexT for the Key Transaction is used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: With OC4J using PolicyClassLoader, no metrics displayed</p>
    <p>In the case where OC4J uses the PolicyClassLoader, the agent generates a java.lang.StackOverflowError in the log and does not provide metrics. In this release, the error does not occur.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix: External metrics for HttpClient include port if host is an IP address</p>
    <p>In the case where an external service call uses HttpClient with an IP address rather than a hostname, the port number is also included. In this release, the port number is not displayed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
