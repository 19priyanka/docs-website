<h3>Upgrade Notices</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <code>newrelic.daemon.ssl</code> ini setting has been removed to increase security. Transport Layer Security (TLS) will now always be used in communication with the New Relic <a href="/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector">collector</a>.</li>
  <li>Laravel Queue support has now been enabled for all users. If <code>newrelic.feature_flag=laravel_queue</code> is set, it will now be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>On FreeBSD and Solaris, when <code>newrelic.daemon.port</code> is configured to use TCP to connect the agent to the daemon, the agent would have difficulty receiving application configuration data from the daemon due to the default timeout of 100 milliseconds matching the delay enforced by the FreeBSD kernel as part of its implementation of Nagle's algorithm. The PHP agent will now set the <code>TCP_NODELAY</code> flag when connecting to the daemon via TCP, which increases the reliability of the agent:daemon connection.</li>
</ul>
