<h3>New Features</h3>
<p><strong>Enhanced visibility into curl_multi_exec calls</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Previously, curl_multi_exec requests appeared as one segment with one total time. Now, we expose the individual segments of a curl_multi_exec request that include individual times and host details. This provides greater visibility as to which URLs are being called and improved ability to troubleshoot slow curl calls.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Configurable daemon start timeout</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The PHP Agent has introduced a new configuration <code>newrelic.daemon.start_timeout</code>. Customers may use this to specify a timeout for the agent to wait for the daemon after a daemon was launched by the agent.</p>
    <p>With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the launched daemon hasn't acquired a socket yet, but rather grants the daemon time to do so.</p>
    <p>It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrade Notice</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For cross agent conformance, the agent attribute <code>httpResponseCode</code> has been renamed to <code>http.statusCode</code>. In <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-940249">PHP agent release 9.4</a>, we erroneously introduced <code>httpResponseCode</code> as the replacement for <code>response.statusCode</code>.</p>
    <p>The new <code>http.statusCode</code> agent attribute name will align with other agents and enables standardized alerts and INSIGHTS queries based on a common attribute name.</p>
    <p>Attributes are reported with both the new <code>http.statusCode</code> name and the<br>legacy <code>httpResponseCode</code> and <code>response.statusCode</code> attribute names.</p>
    <p>Support for legacy attribute names will be removed in future agent versions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues and workarounds</h3>
<p><strong>Potential memory exhaustion for long running transactions</strong></p>
