<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>You must read and agree to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/newrelic.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBerTfWGWkpJRgCk343Zd8wvPXDspXpEnzvCIRR63XplhJAw/viewform">Beta Agreement</a> before using this beta version of the agent.</p>
<p>Dropped support for Node.js 0.6 and 0.8 as well as <code>node-mysql</code> package versions &#x3C; 1.0.0.</p>
<h3>New features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Improved API for writing instrumentation.</p>
    <p>Introduced new classes for writing instrumentation, <code>Shim</code> and <code>DatastoreShim</code>. These classes along with the new <code>newrelic.instrument</code> and <code>newrelic.instrumentDatastore</code> methods make writing 3rd party instrumentation much easier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rewrote instrumentation for Cassandra, Redis, ioredis, MySQL, and MongoDB.</p>
    <p>These instrumentations were rewritten using the new <code>DatastoreShim</code> interface. Their functionality is largely unchanged but the new code should be easier to maintain and extend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Added public API documentation.</p>
    <p>Documentation for the New Relic agent API has been generated using JSDoc and is now hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic">https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic</a>. There you can find documentation on the new classes as well as the pre-existing API methods.</p>
