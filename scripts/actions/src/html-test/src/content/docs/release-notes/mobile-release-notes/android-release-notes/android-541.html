<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Prevent duplication of the New Relic HTTP header used for cross application tracing ('X-NewRelic-Id') if the request is replayed through OkHttp</li>
  <li>The agent will now send the HTTP header 'X-NewRelic-Id' (used for cross application tracing) using exactly that casing (it was previously lowercased)</li>
  <li>Failed OkHttp requests will now correctly report the full error response body</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>This release will be the last to support the New Relic Eclipse plugin for Eclipse IDE's. Eclipse users are encouraged to use the <a href="/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-installation/android/installing-android-apps-eclipse-gradle-plugin">Eclipse Gradle plugin</a> or migrate to <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-installation/android/installing-android-apps-gradle-android-studio">Android Studio</a>. Eclipse users may continue to use this (5.4.1) or any previous agent release.</p>
