<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This release of the Python agent includes a hot fix to address an issue whereby external web service calls made via HTTPS connections were failing. This issue was introduced with version 1.13.0.30 of the agent.</p>
<p>The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic">Python Package Index</a> or can be downloaded directory from our <a href="http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release/">download site</a>.</p>

<h3>Bug fixes/Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Cross Application Tracing feature added in version 1.13.0.30 of the agent was causing failure of external web service calls made over HTTPS connections when that call was made via the 'httplib' module. As the 'httplib' module is used internally in other HTTP client libraries such as the 'urllib', 'urllib2', 'urllib3' and 'requests' modules, they would also have been affected.</li>
  <li>Setting the 'cross_application_tracer.enabled' setting in the agent configuration file to 'false' to disable Cross Application Tracing would cause an exception when an external web service call was being made via the 'httplib' module.</li>
</ul>
