<h3>Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Where instrumentation was not available for the web framework or toolkit being used and web transactions were being named according to the original URL, metric normalization rules were not being correctly applied when metric grouping issues occurred due to a large number of unique URLs. This was resulting in grouping of web transactions metrics under incorrect names leading to the data presented by the UI being unhelpful or misleading.</li>
  <li>Agent would fail when collecting WSGI hosting environment information when an older version of Tornado web server was used which did not provide version information. This would lead to no web transactions metrics being reported as failure occured when agent was trying to register with the New Relic core application.</li>
  <li>Instrumentation of the feedparser module was not catering for the fact that the parse() function could be supplied arguments beyond just the URL to be retreived. This would result in an exception and the web transaction always failing when such additional arguments were supplied.</li>
  <li>Instrumentation for Django was improved so that view handler function name was reported against a web transaction rather than URL when using Django static files mechanism.</li>
  <li>Instrumentation for Django was improved so that technical 404 and 500 response handler function name was used for web transaction when appropriate.</li>
  <li>Instrumentation for Django was improved to ensure that request middleware function name was always used for web transaction name when it returned a valid response.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features changed:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attributes captured from WSGI request environment such as 'REQUEST_METHOD', 'HTTP_REFERER' and 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' are now shown under the 'Request environment' category in error details and slow transaction traces rather than under 'Custom parameters'.</li>
  <li>The HTTP response status for a web transaction is now shown as 'STATUS' under the 'Response properties' category in error details and slow transaction traces rather than under 'Custom parameters'.</li>
</ul>
