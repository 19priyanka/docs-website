<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added support for defining integration arguments as environment variables in the configuration file. When defining the value of an argument in the integration configuration file with something that starts with <code>$</code> (for example <code>hostname: $HOSTNAME</code>) the agent will try to expand the environment variable.</li>
  <li>Added internal configuration options for use in Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
