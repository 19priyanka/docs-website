<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improved the dSYM archive uploader so it will now dispatch asynchronously to the build, and will retry the upload up to 3 times.</li>
  <li>Custom metrics will now accept spaces in the name.</li>
  <li>Improved Cocoapods support. The NewRelicAgent podspec no longer includes version strings in framework paths. This eases pod management and reduces diff clutter when dealing with version control software.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Corrected a bug in crash reporting where certain internal symbols were globally visible when the -ObjC linker flag is present.</li>
  <li>Corrected a bug in crash reporting where Cortex-A9 chips were reported as ARM-Unknown in crash reports.</li>
  <li>Validating the length of activities, only allowing those with a start time within the current session.</li>
</ul>
