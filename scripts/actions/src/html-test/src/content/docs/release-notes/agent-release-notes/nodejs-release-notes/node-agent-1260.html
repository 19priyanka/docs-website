<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Express instrumentation has been fundamentally reworked.</p>
<p>This refactor includes a few bug fixes around error handling and transaction naming, as well as optional higher resolution traces.</p>
<p>Setting <code>feature_flag.express_segments</code> to true in the agent config will make the agent report the amount of time spent in each individual middleware per request</p>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<p>The agent will not report errors handled in an error handler it is monitoring - this is more in line with how the agent does error handling in other contexts.</p>
<p>The agent will now name transactions correctly when an application responds from a middleware.</p>
