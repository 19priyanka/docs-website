<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Adds functionality to the system tray application that will collate information commonly asked for by New Relic support and upload it to S3 when instructed to by the user.</li>
  <li>Response.status is now reported by default in the latest version of the .NET agent on all Insights Transaction events. Previously, this required a configuration change, but now the user simply has to update their agent to the latest version.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixes a bug that would cause a failure to connect to New Relic when local high security was enabled and ssl was disabled. Now you will successfully connect with SSL in this scenario.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where ignoring a status code for error reporting would sometimes not work correctly and the error would still be reported.</li>
  <li>Fixes a bug where CPU usage sometimes increased with agent version 3.6.177.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where applications running older agents making requests of applications running newer agents would sometimes cause the application running the newer agent to drop the transaction.</li>
</ul>
