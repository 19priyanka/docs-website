<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent">update your Infrastructure agent</a>.</p>
<h3>Changed</h3>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Better error handling for NFS support.</li>
  <li>HostInfo plugin to provide uptime for older distros.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The agent will reuse network connections again. Since v1.3.18, the agent created a new connection on each metrics post. Not reusing the connections may lead metrics to be accumulated and submitted with long delays in systems where the connection establishment is slow.</li>
</ul>
