<p>New Relic provides <a href="https://newrelic.com/integrations">integrations for many popular services and frameworks</a>. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration">Flex tool</a> (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete Infrastructure <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations">on-host integration</a>, see our <a href="/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations-sdk">Integrations SDK</a>.</li>
  <li>Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our <a href="/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic">Telemetry SDKs</a>.</li>
  <li>Build a custom <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application">New Relic One application</a> that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Flex? [#what-is-it]</h2>
<p>New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with the New Relic Infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic.</p>
<p>Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an <a href="#example">example config</a>.</p>
<p>After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data">query Flex data</a> in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Flex comes bundled with our Infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://newrelic.com/products/infrastructure/pricing">New Relic Infrastructure Pro</a></li>
  <li>Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (<a href="/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent">update</a> | <a href="/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent#check-version">check version</a>) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does Flex work? [#how-does-it-work]</h2>
<p>Flex uses the Infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the Infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration:</p>
    <div data-component="CollapserGroup" data-prop="W10=">
      <div data-component="Collapser" data-prop="W3sidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJpZCIsInZhbHVlIjoiZXhhbXBsZSJ9LHsidHlwZSI6Im1keEF0dHJpYnV0ZSIsIm5hbWUiOiJ0aXRsZSIsInZhbHVlIjoiRXhhbXBsZSBjb25maWcifV0=">
        <div data-prop-text="title">Example config</div>
        <p>The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named <code>flex-uptime.yml</code>. This would be placed in the Infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at <code>/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml</code>.</p>
        <pre><code>integrations:
  - name: nri-flex    
    config:
      name: linuxUptimeIntegration
      apis:
        - name: Uptime
          commands:
            - run: 'cat /proc/uptime'
              split: horizontal
              split_by: \s+
              set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds]

</code></pre>Some notes on what this configuration does:
        * `run` defines the command to execute.
        * The name indicated by `name: Uptime` is appended with `Sample` to generate an [event](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data) called `UptimeSample`.
        * The `split_by: \s+` splits the fields based on the space character.
        * The command generates [attributes](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#attribute) attached to the `UptimeSample` event. The attributes are named `uptimeSeconds` and `idletimeSeconds`.
      </div>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can then <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data">query your data</a>, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
