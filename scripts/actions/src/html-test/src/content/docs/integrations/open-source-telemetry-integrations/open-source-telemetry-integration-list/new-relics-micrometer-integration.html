<p><a href="https://micrometer.io/">Micrometer</a> provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems, allowing you to instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in. New Relic's Micrometer metrics registry sends your Micrometer telemetry data to your New Relic account.</p>

<h2>Find your data</h2>
<p>To find your data, go to <a href="https://one.newrelic.com/" title="Link opens in a new window.">one.newrelic.com</a> and go to <strong>Your applications</strong> > <strong>Entity explorer</strong>. From the <strong>Entities</strong> screen, search for your service by name. New Relic provides an out-of-the-box overview that includes charts for some of the most useful metrics provided by Micrometer Spring Boot instrumentation.</p>
<p>You can use the out-of-the-box overview as a starting point to build your own dashboards. Click on the <code>...</code> icon in a chart to add that chart to a dashboard or view the query behind the chart to modify it and it add it to your dashboard.</p>
