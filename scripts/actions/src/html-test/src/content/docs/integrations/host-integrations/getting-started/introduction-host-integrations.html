<p><a href="/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations">New Relic infrastructure integrations</a> allow you to send data from popular products and services to New Relic. On-host integrations allows you to collect and send data from core infrastructure services to our platform. For a complete list of core services that you can instrument, see <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations">List of on-host integrations</a>.</p>
<h2>Get started [#features]</h2>
<p>To get started with infrastructure on-host integrations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Browse the lists of <a href="/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list">on-host integrations</a>.</li>
  <li>If you do not already have New Relic infrastructure monitoring enabled, <a href="/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic">install the infrastructure agent</a>.</li>
  <li>Follow the procedures to install and configure the selected on-host integration, including prerequisites for compatibility and other requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we don't currently offer an integration for a service you use, consider creating your own integration with <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration">Flex</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>After you install and activate an integration, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data">Filter and analyze</a> the metrics and configuration data in <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure">Infrastructure UI</a>.</li>
  <li>Create <a href="/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data">custom queries and charts</a> of your integration data.</li>
  <li>Create <a href="/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-condition">alert conditions</a> to monitor problems with your services' performance in <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information#integration">New Relic's alerts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Monitor remote and multi-tenant configurations [#multiple-instances]</h2>
<p>Some configurations may use third party elements, such as databases, which reside in non-accessible, remote hosts. Our integrations can fetch data from local and remote hosts or servers, ensuring a continuous monitoring of your service. They also support multi-tenant clustered configurationsâ€”by abstracting the service from the host, multiple entities can be monitored as remote instances.</p>
<p>You can activate remote monitoring and multi-tenancy in the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations with the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/remote-monitoring-host-integrations"><code>remote_monitoring</code> parameter</a>.</p>
