<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>When connecting <a href="/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-services-infrastructure#connect">AWS to a New Relic Infrastructure integration</a>, during the <strong>Review</strong> phase, you receive the AWS error <code>Invalid principal in policy</code>.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Check the type of integration you want to install. New Relic can obtain monitoring data from services and endpoints that are located in all <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html" title="Link opens in a new window.">AWS regions</a> except from China regions.</p>
<p>You will see this error when trying to configure integrations from an account that uses China.</p>
