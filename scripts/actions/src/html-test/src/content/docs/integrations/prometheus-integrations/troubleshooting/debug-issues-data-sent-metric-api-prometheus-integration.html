You want to see the exact data being sent from your Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Docker or Kubernetes to the Metric API.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>You can configure the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration to show the raw data being sent to the standard output stream. To see the exact data that is being sent to the Metric API, set the <code>EMITTERS</code> environment variable to <code>"api,stdout"</code>.</p>
