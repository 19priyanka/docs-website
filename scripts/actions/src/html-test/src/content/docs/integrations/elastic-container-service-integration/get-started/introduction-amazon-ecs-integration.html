<p>Our ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html">Amazon ECS</a> environment. The ECS integration works well with other integrations, so you can also <a href="/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/monitor-services-running-amazon-ecs">monitor services running on ECS</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs/index.html">Amazon Elastic Container Service</a> (ECS) is a scalable container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on Amazon EC2 clusters. Our ECS integration instruments the underlying container instance (EC2 launch type) and the container layer by reporting metrics from ECS objects. The integration gives you insight into your ECS instances, tasks, services, and containers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://one.newrelic.com">one.newrelic.com</a> > Entity explorer > ECS dashboard:</strong> The ECS integration reports performance data about your Amazon ECS containers.</p>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View your data in pre-built dashboards for immediate insight into your ECS environment.</li>
  <li>Create your own queries and charts in the <a href="/docs/insights"></a><a href="/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder">query builder</a> from automatically reported data.</li>
  <li>Create <a href="/docs/ecs-integration-recommended-alert-conditions">alert conditions</a> on ECS data.</li>
  <li>Explore entities using the <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts">entity explorer</a>.</li>

  <p>New Relic also offers an <a href="/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-ecsecr-monitoring-integration">ECS cloud integration</a>, which reports a different data set than our on-host integration. For complete ECS monitoring, we recommend enabling both integrations.</p>
