<p>We provide <a href="https://newrelic.com/integrations">hundreds of solutions</a> to get your data into New Relic so you can analyze the data in one place. They give you a steady flow of useful data to fix problems quickly, maintain complex systems, improve your code, and accelerate your digital transformation.</p>
<p>You can bring in data from hundreds of applications, frameworks, services, operating systems, and other technologies. Our integrations gather the data, and the agents send it to New Relic. The solution you need may require you to install both an integration and an agent. In some cases, you can just install our agents that contain integrations, such as our APM agents.</p>
<p>Whatever data you need to bring in, chances are that we have options for your environment. If you prefer to make your own solutions, we also offer tools to get you started.</p>
