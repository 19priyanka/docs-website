<p>New Relic provides open source integrations that report telemetry data from telemetry tools to your New Relic account.</p>
<h2>Types of integrations [#about]</h2>
<p>We have open source integrations that report data from OpenCensus, OpenTelemetry, DropWizard, Prometheus, and <a href="/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations">more</a>. With these solutions, you can aggregate all your telemetry data in one place: the New Relic platform.</p>
<p>See <a href="/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integration-list/">our list of open source telemetry integrations</a>. To browse all of our solutions, see our <a href="https://newrelic.com/integrations">integrations page</a>.</p>
<h2>How they work</h2>
<p>These integrations were built using our <a href="/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic">Telemetry SDKs</a>, which are open-source language-specific libraries for reporting metrics, trace data, and other telemetry data to New Relic. If our pre-built <a href="https://newrelic.com/integrations">integrations</a> don't meet your needs, you can use the <a href="/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic">Telemetry SDKs</a> to build your own telemetry tools.</p>
<p>Under the hood, data reported by these solutions are ingested via our <a href="/docs/data-ingest-apis">data ingest APIs</a>. For example, metrics reported by the DropWizard exporter are ingested via the <a href="/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api">Metric API</a>, so to understand how to query and chart that type of data, you could read <a href="/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data">Query metric data</a>.</p>
