<p>Our <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Azure</a> integrations allow you to monitor and report data about your Azure services to New Relic, providing a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place.</p>
<p>The Azure integrations are not the same as <a href="/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation">New Relic APM's .NET support for Azure</a>.</p>
<h2>Requirements [#permissions]</h2>
<p>Check the <a href="/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list">Azure integrations documentation</a> for requirements on individual integrations.</p>
<p>New Relic cannot obtain monitoring data from resources that are located in Azure Government or that were created through the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model">classic deployment model</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>After you <a href="/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/getting-started/activate-azure-integrations">activate your Azure integration</a>, New Relic begins to query your Azure platform services according to a regular <a href="/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations">polling interval</a>. You can use our integrations UI to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View performance data from <a href="/docs/infrastructure/integrations/find-use-infrastructure-integration-data">Integrations dashboards</a> that automatically scale as you make changes to your ecosystem.</li>
  <li>Manage <a href="/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-alerts-add-edit-or-view-host-alert-information#integration">alert conditions</a> with alerts.</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data">Query your data</a>.</li>
</ul>
