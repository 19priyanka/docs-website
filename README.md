# New Relic Docs

This repo contains the documentation website code and Markdown source files for  our preview Docs site: docs-preview.newrelic.com. When it's ready, all of our docs will live here.

Read on to learn more about who we are and how you can contribute.

## Why it matters

From early on, our Docs site has been managed by a team of writers. We've always welcomed contributions from anyone at New Relic. We credit our technical accuracy and comprehensive documentation to this openness. In a sense, it's documentation as conversation.

Open sourcing our docs seemed like a great way to expand this conversation beyond New Relic.

We'd love to hear from you. Come join the conversation.

## Get started

On every one of our docs, you can [create an issue]([link to issue template page](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose)) or [edit a page]([link to more detailed instructions about contributing](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)). 

### Create an issue

We have a set of issue templates to help you get started.

### Edit a page

When you edit a doc, you'll be able to start editing it on GitHub right away. See our [Contributors guide]() for information on how to fork our site and submit pull requests.

Our [Style guide]() will give you some insight into how we think about writing and documenation, as well as our flavor of Markdown.

## Technical detail

Our site is generated by Gatsby and built with the [`gatsby-theme-newrelic`](https://github.com/newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/tree/develop/packages/gatsby-theme-newrelic).
